Phone is working great so far! Definitely worth the price! Would recommend this seller to anyone looking for an iPhone in good shape! Not sure on other colors but with the pink I would assume mostly females have owned them previously and most women I know keep their phones in cases so that probably contributes to the quality of the specific phone I ordered so keep in mind who would have owned the specific phone you order!",

My expectations were low and was completely fine with having scratches on the phone and low battery health. But when I received my phone my expectations were beyond exceeded. My phone has no scratches anywhere and has 99% battery health! The phone did come a little 'dirty' on the edges but came off easily with an alcohol wipe. It takes a charge perfectly, camera works and looks good, sound quality is perfect. Everything I've tested so far works like new. Of course everyone will receive a different renewed phone but I think with the extreme discount a renewed phone gives (refurbished off bestbuy is 500, i paid 300 on amazon), as well as guaranteed 30 day refunds and returns, it is 100% worth it. I will be buying renewed iphones off amazon for all my future phones! :)",

I upgraded from my 11 to this 13 and im pleased with my purchase. Local stores wanted 600$+ and limited colors. This Came with a screen protector already installed and the charger wire which i was not expecting so that was a plus for me. 2/27/25 is when I receive my phone. if anything changes ill update. for now, Im definitely buying another one for my work phone. Price is right, condition is excellent. Few minor scratches marks from previous phone case but for a used phone no complaints looks new.",

The exterior was in good condition, the frame was nice with no scratches, and even the back and camera worked well. After setting up the phone, I checked everything and was very satisfied to find that the screen hadn’t been replaced, it’s the original screen. Overall, everything is great. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the battery capacity is only at 85%. If it were higher, it would definitely deserve 5 stars. But for a renewed product, this is already excellent",

I was very skeptical buying a phone online, as of course you could really get anything. But this phone is literally perfect. It took a couple days to get here, and it was perfectly unscathed. No scratches, no cracks, and it functions so perfectly. It’s as if we got a brand new iPhone. I definitely recommend this product. Also for reference we bought the best condition option. 100% worth it!",

My only complaint is that I ordered this in “excellent” condition and the battery health is 88%. Apple recommends replacing batteries after 85%, so this battery isn’t really that great overall. Anything above 90 would’ve been much preferred but overall this was a great purchase for the price. Color is super cute in person.Update: 3 days later I am updating my stars from 4 to 3. The battery health % has already dropped to 86 from 88 in 3 days. This battery is not good anymore like I mentioned in my previous review. It already needs replacing or the replacement this seller used is garbage.",

No cracks or scratches or any residue on the front or back, or sides. 100% battery health. The picture quality is super good, feels great, doesn’t lag or anything, battery lasts a long time from one charge to 100% depending on what you do, the brightness of the screen is nice as well, and it’s easy to set up, i transferred my data from my previous iPhone to this one. I basically saved $200-300 on a brand new phone. Nothing about it feels refurbished, it feels and runs like a brand new phone.",

Reviews were great overall and you do get a month to return if it ends up being defective. I upgraded from an iPhone 6 which was still working fine but I wanted to find an upgrade before it actually breaks and I'm without a phone. So the upgrade from a 10 year old phone was massive even though this one is already 3ish years old.I received it with about 87% battery life. For about the first week, I was on it constantly all day every day getting everything set up just the way I want it and trying out new features that weren't available on my old obsolete phone. And everything works perfectly. The only way I can really tell it was used was by the scratches around (not on) the back camera lenses, but since I hardly even look at the back of my phone it doesn't bother me.I'm not someone who always has to have the latest tech, so this has worked really well for me. I think I might always choose to just go through a reputable dealer for a used phone anytime I need to upgrade.",

      "reviewText": "So let me start out by saying that I am not one to purchased refurbished phones and whenever something would happen to one of mine and I had to turn it into the Phone company and they would send me a refurbished one to replace mine, there was always something wrong with them. So, that has always made me a little bit gunshy regarding that particular situation.With that said, as a full-time caregiver for the last 11 years, I have not been able to work and unfortunately can no longer purchase the best of the best with the flagship phones that I used to get back in the day. Many of my parents doctors do some video visits and some of them actually prefer FaceTime so as a result, having an iPhone was actually partly a necessity for that reason.I have always been an Android girl, )still have that too), so I didn’t quite know what iPhone I needed to get, but after some research, I finally settled on what I thought would be the best choice for me both with regard to the technology inside and with the price as well as the warranty.I had actually considered either an iPhone 11 or an iPhone 13 as my choice. As we are now on the 15 I found the 13 to be the wisest choice of the two.After researching many different sites, some very reputable and actually recommended by people, I decided to land on Amazon‘s renewed program because I’ve always had a nice experience when there have been any issues with a product and I’ve never had any problems with customer service. They’ve always been very helpful and I thought if anything were to happen with the phone, I would be hoping to have the same type of experience.In looking at the options, I chose to actually pay more to have one that was put forth by Amazon themselves because they offered a year warranty as opposed to many of the others who were a bit cheaper and offered maybe 30 days or so etc.And hey, so far, so good! The Phone arrived. It was in perfect cosmetic condition and I have not had any issues with it since. The battery was at 87% and although I would’ve liked to had it higher than that, I was glad to see that it still was pretty snappy when I needed it to be.So I would say that I have been very pleased so far and I would absolutely recommend the renewed program to anyone interested, but can only speak to the actual product provided by Amazon itself, however, I’m sure many of the third-party individuals that sell refurbished items may have some really good product themselves.Ah…there I go again…refurbished…renewed…to-may-toe…to-mah-toe… well you get the jist…",

Like press a couple buttons on both phones simple. And no getting permission from the account holder if you are on a family plan. Data, ya that’s simple too, as long as you back up your old phone over the cloud or onto a computer. And no bullshit Verizon charges for a “new” SIM card or waiting there! Seriously I’ll never buy a phone another way (yes, I always buy my phones outright, personal preference).Technical details aside, the phone was listed in excellent condition and it is, one or two small dings to the metal sides but otherwise perfect. 80% battery health (which lasts longer than my 2nd generation SE at 92%). I did not realize the seller was sending by FedEx signature required, but luckily it was able to go pick it up at the local shipping center. Packaged securely, no damage in transport.Highly recommend.",

I had the phone in my hands within 48 hours of placing the order, which surpassed all my expectations. It came with a charger (both the cable and block). The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal. The first thing I noticed was that there are some small chips and scratches around the edges of the device, most noticeable on the top, but with a case on, the damage will barely be visible. I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust.The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity). Overall, I've been happy with the performance so far, especially for the price. I would buy from MobileSupply again!",

If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right.  There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case).  If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear.  However, the phone was not sold as \"flawless\" so some wear and tear is to be expected.  For my use case, the phone met my needs.  I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws  The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch.  I haven't pulled off the screen protector  to see if the underlying screen has scratches.  if there is wear-and-tear on the screen (ex. small scratches from keys, etc.) they are minimal and not noticeable thought the screen protector.  Overall satisfied with this purchase for my use case.",
