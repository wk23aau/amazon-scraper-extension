Just be aware if you buying this as your main cellphone i do not recommend this refurbished ones, they always will have damage on them, I was expecting minor scratches not big damage like I show on the pictures. Another thing when I open the orders to leave this review the same excellent condition phone price was $20 less than I have pay for in les than 4 hours because I ordered at 11am and was delivered in the afternoon prime same day.","helpfulVotes":8},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Great product but really bad generic charger 2.1A 10W","date":"Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2024","body":"The Samsung S21 Ultra has exceeded my expectations in almost every aspect. From its stunning display to its powerhouse performance, this flagship smartphone truly stands out in the crowded market. Let me delve into the details of what makes this device a must-have, while also shedding light on an area that could use some improvement.First and foremost, let's talk about the display. The S21 Ultra boasts a breathtaking Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, delivering unparalleled clarity and vibrancy. Whether I'm streaming my favorite movies or gaming with friends, every visual detail pops with stunning realism. It's like having a cinema in the palm of my hand.Performance-wise, the S21 Ultra is an absolute beast. Powered by the latest Snapdragon processor (or Exynos depending on the region), coupled with generous RAM, this smartphone effortlessly handles multitasking, gaming, and productivity tasks with lightning-fast speed. Apps launch instantly, and I can seamlessly switch between tasks without any lag or stutter.One of the standout features of the S21 Ultra is its camera system. With a quad-camera setup including a 108MP main sensor, 10x optical zoom, and 100x Space Zoom, this phone lets me capture moments with astonishing clarity and detail. Whether it's a scenic landscape or a close-up shot, the photos turn out sharp and vibrant, even in low light conditions.The sleek design of the S21 Ultra is another aspect that I absolutely adore. From its premium build quality to its ergonomic feel in hand, Samsung has nailed the aesthetics of this device. It's a perfect blend of style and functionality, making it a pleasure to use and show off.However, no device is without its flaws, and in the case of the S21 Ultra, it's the included charger. While the smartphone itself supports fast charging up to 25W, the included 2.1A 10W ONLY charger feels somewhat underwhelming. In today's fast-paced world, where every minute counts, having a more powerful charger would significantly enhance the user experience, allowing for quicker top-ups on the go.","helpfulVotes":20},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    As Advertised","date":"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2025","body":"Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G, US Version, 128GB, Phantom Black - Unlocked (Renewed) is in Excellent Condition as advertised.  I especially like the 10X optical zoom lens. The cameraâ€™s Night Mode setting is capable of photographing night sky constellations.  The camera is capable of saving photos in RAW format by downloading Samsung's RAW App.  Image resolution of the main 1X 108MP camera lens is more grainy than expected.  I'm not sure if it is just a defective main lens in this camera or as a result of software processes such as pixel binning?  The Gorilla Glass screen should prevent display damages.  I think the curved glass edges makes tempered glass screen protectors difficult to stay on and I'm having issues finding a tempered glass that doesn't greatly reduce the sensitivity for this S21 Ultra's fingerprint scanner.  Overall, an impressively designed smartphone by Samsung.","helpfulVotes":6},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    You'll be very pleased!","date":"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2025","body":"Starting out, I was super skeptical about getting a used phone online.

A full charge probably lasts like 6hrsðŸ˜­ But I guess 6hrs can get you through the day. I had an A20s and a full charge on that could last a whole day - 24hrs, so my expectations for the S21 Ultra in that area were not met. The phone also gets a lil too warm for my liking but the phone doesn't alert that it's overheating and battery capacity is still at 5000 mAh so I guess nothing significantly bad happened. Lastly, my phone only came with a cable and no adapter.

Now I say nearly because it definitely had one or two things here or there that gave me iffy feelings at first. One example of this is that there were very mild scratches on the side of the camera bump, and while normally that would bother me a lot more, I didn't mind it too much since it wasn't effecting the phones performance, and I put a case over it anyway so I don't see them now. I inserted the sim card from my old phone and it all seems to work just fine with no issues that I am able to see as of this moment, though I hear stories of phones sometimes giving up on the sim card after about a month, so I will have to wait and see on that front. And finally I should say that I have always been incredibly skeptical of buying used phones in general, let alone online, but given the price of the phone and the fairly high standards I set for it I am really rather impressed. If anything I just mentioned happens to change sometime in the near future I will definitely come back and change my review accordingly but until then I will 100% recommend this phone for the price","helpfulVotes":12},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Great phone","date":"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2025","body":"Great phone and worth every penny."},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Wanted to love this phone but...","date":"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2024","body":"I really wanted to love this phone but there was one issue that I just couldn't get past & that was the camera.

That was the only issue with it though, it looked in excellent condition, with no scratches or anything. If I wasn't so bug on the camera I would have kept it but I had to return it for that issue.

That being said, so far I haven't really been impressed with the camera despite it being one of the major selling points of the phone itself. I noticed a small scratch across one of the lenses but surely that doesn't impact the camera quality and focusing ability that much. My phone's camera doesn't seem quite as capable, again could be due to the fact it's renewed. And likewise the battery life seems to be less than half of what it was claimed to be. The phone body itself was pretty beat up but that's not a big deal since it was thrown straight into an OtterBox. I would say it gets the job done and you get what you pay for. I just wasn't as impressed as I was hoping I would be. The seller did a great job packaging the phone and the delivery was prompt.

If I had any real complaints it was the fact that the UPS driver that 'delivered' it didn't even get out of his van to knock on the door. I had been waiting for the phone and checking my package tracking only to get told a delivery had been 'attempted' at 1:11 pm.But there was nothing on either of my doors that indicated that they had actually came and knocked on the door. In fact I heard no knocks at all. So they really came to the house, saw they couldn't leave it in the mailbox and took it to the Autoparts store up the street. Not cool.But back to the phone, everything's been working great for a few weeks so far. So i'm pretty happy with it. S-pen functionality is really good too.

I went for the excellent option, and I'd say it was worth the extra. No major scratches, a little dirty but that's okay. However, when I went to turn in this beautiful powerful behemoth, I saw the dreaded At&T logo. After hours of fiddling with the sim card trying to get it to accept my at&t unlocking code, I finally got it to work (without putting in my code?). I managed to disable most of the at&t bloatware but it's still there alright and will probably haunt me. But it connected to Metro by T-Mobile just fine after a online transfer of IMEIs. It works perfectly, the fastest phone Ive ever owned and battery seems to be pretty darn good considering the age of the phone. The 100x zoom is crazy but the camera will need fiddling to get those perfect shots to compete with the pixel. Good phone, not so great experience setting up the phone. Plus is a fast charger was included.","helpfulVotes":24},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Phone still linked to previous owners account - updated 4/25","date":"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2024","body":"Product was in usable condition as expected of a pre-owned phone.

I took the time to find the best case for the optional spen (supcase UB Pro), and having the s pen with this phone was an absolute game changer for my organization and photo editing skills...so much functionality. Loved it, especially the handwritten notes you can jot down without having to even turn the phone on.So it was all going great, until it slipped out of my hand and fell 4 inches into a clean toilet bowl. I fished it out right away and dried it off, but I knew the phone comes with an IP68 rating and I had a spigen Neoflex screen protector and the UB Pro case, so I figured my phone would be more than fine. With the protection rating of the bare phone PLUS all the extra protection I carried it in, in my head I was more than fine....Guess again. Phone shorted out within 20 minutes and I got the green screen of death at startup. Completely fried. So that really socks. What the hell is the point of IP68 if a 4\" drop-slide into some water bricks the phone? I have no idea but hopefully my testimony will be a warning to some: treat this phone as if any water will absolutely destroy it, because it just might. I'm still trying to figure out how to sign into my Samsung account on another device without having this one available, because of Samsungs 2FA they ONLY want to send a code to my s21U, which is bricked.

I wil update if that changes.","helpfulVotes":5},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Awesome","date":"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2025","body":"Good"},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Nice for the money","date":"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2023","body":"Device arrived just as described. Very good condition and unlocked. Phone has a nice quality feel and weight to it. Doesn't feel or look cheap at all like some other manufacturers phones do that are built with plastic. Phone was fast and clear once I activated it and uploaded all of my data. Purchaed this phone in an emergency to replace my then current device which was starting to glich. So far I am very happy with this choice. Planning on upgrading from this device to the new S23 Ultra soon. I'd give this seller my business again in the future based on this experience.PS: I gave the fingerprint reader only 2 stars simply because I personally do not ever use biometric features on my devices and can not provide any opinion.","helpfulVotes":6},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":3,"title":"3.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Burned or poorly replaced screen.","date":"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2024","body":""},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":3,"title":"3.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Good phone","date":"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2024","body":"Screen is big and it looks decent.120hz refresh rate nice"},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Refurbished but works great and looks new.","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024","body":"We bought this for my mother-in-law, itâ€™s her first android so sheâ€™s not really sure what to expect. The phone arrived looking brand new, I couldnâ€™t find a scratch on it. It was really low on battery but itâ€™s a refurbished phone, it got fixed and didnâ€™t get a charge. After a full charge, no issues whatsoever. Everything is fully functional as far as I can tell.The real test is the test of time, just gotta see if it survives normal wear and tear.","helpfulVotes":1},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Nice","date":"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2025","body":"Everything was great, device is like new!"},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":3,"title":"3.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Refurbished phone works great, charger and cord did not work.","date":"Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2024","body":"The wall plug in and cord did not work, phone is otherwise great.
