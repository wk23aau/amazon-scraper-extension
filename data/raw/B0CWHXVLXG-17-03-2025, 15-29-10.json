{"reviews":[{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Great Value","date":"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025","body":"I will start off by saying I have no interest in $1000+ cell phones - to me they are disposable devices that get replaced every few years. That said, this is the perfect phone for my purposes. The coverage (carrier dependent), audio, display quality and speed are perfect for my needs. I use the this as - wait for it - a phone - as well for texting and taking some pictures, mapping directions, etc.This is my 4th or 5th Motorola phone, and I have always been happy with the value proposition. Even through my former carrier the Motorola phones have always had much less bloatware than, say Samsung (ugh) which loads up their phones with all kinds of nonsense. When you buy it unlocked it comes with even less bloatware, and you can delete or disable most of it.It is much faster than my old phone, which one would expect, with 8MB of RAM, and 128MB of internal storage. There are several things I like about this phone, a couple being that it still has a headphone jack, and also it will take a micro SD card for additional storage. Both of these features are found on very few phones these days. There are 2 features that are unique to Motorola on the phones I have had, including this one, that are REALLY convenient. You can open the camera app just by twisting your wrist, and you can turn on the flashlight by a chopping motion - no screen to wake up or app to start up - brilliant really.Also, the battery life (5000ma) is phenomenal. I can use it all day, leave it overnight, and it will still have plenty of charge the next day. I really only charge it every other day. I will note that I turn off as many background processes as I can, don't watch movies on the phone (really?), and in general use it as a tool, not a brain-sucking toy (editorial comment :-). If you want a well functioning device and don't want to spend huge dollars this phone may be right for you.","helpfulVotes":134},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Professionalism in a budget phone!","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025","body":"This phone is outstanding! I bought it for my mom. I was upgrading her old a10e Samsung and this phone completely blew away my expectations. It IS unlocked and has 128gb and 8gb of ram. It handles apps like a pro and it's camera is amazing for it to be a budget phone.Setup was easy, all I had to do was attach the cable to both phones and it automatically downloaded all of her apps. It charges fast and has an excellent battery life.It is fast and efficient. I am so happy I went with Motorola. I was going to buy her another Samsung A phone but it had less gb ram compared to this phone and was $20 higher!I highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a replacement. The screen and display are nice and bright and clear. The volume is excellent on it.

I like the battery time, and the no frills style of phone.The one frills I liked on my previous model was two of the gestures - shake for flashlight, rotate for camera.  I upgraded the OS shortly after getting this phone and neither of those gestures work on this model.  Perhaps that will get fixed with a later update?Also a little disappointed with the lack of ringtones to replace the dopey one that is the default (it says \"hello moto\", so stupid).  But that is easy to fix so not a big issue.  That spurred me to browse a few and I quickly found one that I really like.The issues are all minor.  Bottom line is this is still the phone I like - good battery life, inexpensive, and functional.","helpfulVotes":2},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Excellent phone for the price","date":"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2025","body":"We have high end Android phones but one family tends to lose or break phones pretty frequently, so I'm not going to get that one a $900 phone.  We got this one as a replacement device after the most recent incident (phone dropped in a lake).  And it is remarkably fast and high quality.  Moto has a nice, clean Android OS.  Setup was very easy with all apps etc. quickly loaded from Play and photos etc. reloaded from the cloud.  The phone performs great with only barely perceptible performance, screen, sound differences from my top end phone and a longer battery life.  A really great phone at this price point.","helpfulVotes":28},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":3,"title":"3.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Battery life is very subpar","date":"Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2024","body":"I got this phone to replace my old 4g TCL 30 phone, and I'm pretty meh about the whole affair.The good:It's a reasonably priced unlocked android phone, it works with Mint Mobile (and therefore would work with T-Mobile and Metro, ymmv) and is lightweight and slim. It receives and makes calls and takes pretty good pictures, though I'm not a big picture taking person, so others may have issues, don't know. The 5G service is quite nice and allows for a better connection when we are out in the country than my old TCL 30 4g. The screen is vivid and the look of video/pics/etc is pretty good.The bad:Everything is Google, there is no native barebones alternatives like my old TCL 30. It's annoying being asked to set up all the different google apps every time I need to open one... If I wanted to use all the features of each one, I would. Ex: I just want to see the pictures I've taken, I don't want to be reminded to set up the app to save my pics to the cloud every damned time I open it. I use it to take pics of electrical schematics so I can complete my work without returning to the stand book to verify different connections etc ... It's almost like Google saying \"are you suuuuuure you don't want to\" every time like I'm a child or something.... It's very annoying and slows me down.The UglyBattery life is absolutely horrible. My old phone, with the same battery size, could stream Spotify to my earbuds through an entire shift and not be less than 60% battery, even after 2 years of doing this every Mon-Fri for 9-10 hours a day. The first day I used this Motorola the same way, my battery was down to 30% when I punched out to go home. That's absolutely pathetic. If it wasn't for the fact that this was a sub-$200 phone, I would have returned it and gotten another TCL phone. This is the main reason I gave this a 3 star rating. If you don't stream music all day like I do, or use it all day like a younger person then it would probably last longer. As with most things, your milage may vary....Another serious negative is the button arrangement and shared capabilities, I'll explain.The phone has the typical up/down volume button above the power button on the right side of the screen. The issue comes when the power button is also the fingerprint sensor. It's nice to just brush it to open the phone, but it's absolutely annoying when taking a screenshot or trying to restart the phone. It seems to just spaz out when hitting up volume + power button for a screenshot to restart, or any of the other button combos the phone is capable of.Overall, for someone who doesn't stream music it's a decent unlocked phone, but for someone who actually does it's a no go because of battery life. That and the 'Bad' section above is why this is a 3 star phone at best. I honestly feel Im being generous giving it 3 stars as this is gonna be a $180 paperweight when unlocked TCL 50s hit Amazon....","helpfulVotes":84},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Great features, not crazy expensive","date":"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2025","body":"For a budget phone, it ticks a lot of boxes.  8GB RAM, 128GB Storage, Androd 14 (15 just arrived), decent display, head phone jack, wireless charging, good battery life, nice camera, works fine on Mint (T-Mobile) 5G.

I'm not a heavy phone user, I just need to check messages and mail. Place some online orders and browse the Internet. Occasionally, I take photos. So, this phone is fit for my intended use and the price point is just right.I had a previous Motorola phone which served me well until the battery died and screen cracked in several places. So, I got this Motorola phone which by the look of the specs and the couple weeks that I've used it has been good so far.I bought it for the price, size, battery life, good experience with previous Motorola phone, VoLte and 5g connection.The color didn't matter to me since I put it in a rugged case anyway.The camera takes decent pictures and it seems to do better in low light than my previous Motorola.The battery lasts me a full day on medium usage, no heavy video or music streaming for hours though. I watch maybe around 5-10 short videos on it per day. If you need to constantly stream music or videos on it, then the battery might not last a full day.This phone is a bit on the heavy side though, much heavier than my previous Motorola, especially with a case that I added onto it. But overall, it's working as expected.","helpfulVotes":3},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Gets the job done, won't blow your socks off","date":"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2025","body":"My old phone, a Samsung Galaxy S10, no longer seemed to be able to connect to network data anymore, and I did everything except factory reset to try to fix it because I have too much on it I don't want to erase and backing it all up is too difficult (some apps are out of date and no longer supported, etc) especially without knowing for sure that a FR would work.So, I bought this phone as a sort of last ditch solution.  Honestly, it's better than I expected.  Nice screen size.  Looks decent.  Has all the capabilities I need on a daily basis.  However, I will say this: there are lots of elements of this phone, despite it being four years newer than my Galaxy S10, that are below the S10's specs: screen resolution is a big one, as is processor speed and RAM. Superficially is the exterior which, unlike the Samsung, doesn't have tempered glass, but I actually kind of like the exterior of this slightly better even if it does look less \"premium\" because the S10's glass on the backside of the phone just smudges and scratches.  Also, the phone is about 6.7oz or so, so it's heavier than the S10 by about a half oz.In terms of the other elements of comparison I noted: RAM is 4gigs vs the Galaxy's 8 gigs, and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is definitely a more budget processor vs the Galaxy S10's processor specs.  The biggest though is the screen resolution at 1612x720 vs the Galaxy's 1440x3040.  The PPI (pixel density) is essentially half that of my old phone, so I definitely notice that in watching videos, and I'm sure you will too if you're going from a more \"premium\" brand.The good?  The camera at 50mp vs the Galaxy's 10mp, the battery at 50mAh which is bigger (but no wireless charging), the screen size, the exterior styling which I actually like, and of course the elephant in the room which is price.Is this a good deal for the price?  Absolutely.  I will be keeping mine.  Though the specs aren't as good in critical areas vs my old phone, nothing beats owning your phone outright at only $150 and not having to be tethered to a network or make payments.  So is it worth it?  Absolutely.  Just don't expect it to perform at the levels of any \"premium\" brand in terms of multitasking or expect the same kind of beautiful granularity on videos.  It's a budget phone, after all, so expect some compromises, but it gets the job done and again, the price is only about 1.5x the *monthly* cost of buying a premium phone from Verizon etc.  So literally, after about 2 months it's basically paid for itself vs buying a \"premium\" brand phone direct from the big networks.","helpfulVotes":3},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Model Still Checks All the Boxes","date":"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2025","body":"I bought a couple previous versions of this phone and have always been pleased with the choice. As such, when an app started not supporting my last one I realized it was probably time to upgrade. From what I can tell this one is going to at least meet expectations as well.The battery has great life (it will last a few days, even with some streaming) and recharges quickly. The price is very good for the quality. It's perfect for a person who needs a phone that meets all of the basic needs for a smartphone, has great battery life and will not break the bank if you accidentally drop it in the lake.I have always really liked the gesture feature that lets you turn on the flashlight with the shake of the wrist rather than having to unlock the phone and find the button.

I’m an old retired guy who doesn’t need the latest greatest phone or a costly unlimited data plan just to get a “free” phone. News flash, nothings ever free….fwiw Verizon’s “free” phone would have added nearly $100 a month to our Verizon plan. Found this unlocked 2024 model Moto 5G on Amazon for $149, and I’m glad I did.Even an old guy like me was able to resister this phone to our account from my ez chair, swap the SIM card over and download all my photos and contacts over in about an hour, all from the comforts of home.This Moto 5 has great battery life and works like a charm. Great camera and does all I need it to do and much more. Has some really cool features too, like fingerprint and facial recognition ID, a three finger screenshot feature and I’m sure there’s more, I just need to borrow a 10yo kid to show me how.If you’re looking for a rugged low cost new (2024) phone this one seems tough to beat.And as a bonus it’s a Made in the US Motorola product.

Compass is a little iffy even after calibration(the silly figure 8 or 3-axis dance).

This is the 3rd one I've purchased and will most likely continue to buy.","helpfulVotes":5},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Great and low cost","date":"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2025","body":"Love the phone.

It feels like 91% is retina burning and 90% is too dim. Not sure how to get a better balance.- Battery won't come close to what they're claiming; I'm not a power user (1-3 hours a day gaming), but the battery just bleeds life.

Worked on it for a week. No transfer possible via wifi, sd card, usb c data transfer cable, nothing worked. So I returned it. Got a Samsung A15. Motorola was a better phone in my opinion with far less junk installed that cannot be removed. The A15 however, had a case available with a sliding camera cover. That was a slam dunk as I had just been wondering why nobody was making cases with sliding lens covers, so when I saw exactly what I imagined for a sturdy protective case I replaced both of our phones with A15's, specifically because of the protective case with camera cover, not due to the phone itself. I spent a lot of time going through the app permissions and uninstalling everything I could and the motorola has way more going for it than the samsung in my opinion.","helpfulVotes":8},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":3,"title":"3.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Beware no charger included but a good phone otherwise","date":"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024","body":"Bought this phone to replace my 8 year old Samsung.

I'd say you get about 80% of the usage and quality of \"Flagship\" phones with virtually all the functionality at a cost that's about 25-30% of flagship prices. I've had phones fly away riding my motorcycle (Use a GOOD mount lol), dropped, knocked off while working on car and a lot of other usage cycles that are not amenable to good phone life.

And I don't play games on it.  But everything I have used works great.Besides working fine, what else is there to say?First, the battery life is great -- I put it on a shelf to just be an alarm clock for 24 hours, and it used about 15% of the battery.  Even with some web browsing and a lot of podcast listening during the day, I have never seen the battery below 45%, charging it once a day.The screen is bright and clear and big (for the phone's size), with refresh rate of 60Hz normally and 120Hz while scrolling (you can tell w/developer tools).  There are better phone screens, but I never find myself wishing it were better.  There is a black dot where the selfie camera is, but that's the price you pay for a wall-to-wall screen.The rear camera is 48M pixels, like the new Google Pixel phones.  I don't know if it's actually as good, but if I want to do art photography, I don't use a phone.  It has a separate macro lens that you can select easily with the camera app, and I have never had trouble getting a sharp photo of anything, yet.  Like the screen, I've never wished it was better.The built-in speakers are unexpectedly good: there's one at each end, and, yeah, they do stereo as well as you can expect for speakers 4\" apart, I guess, but the sound quality and volume are significantly better than typical for reasonably-priced phones.The cell reception is better than the Pixel phones I've used, but, surprisingly, not as good as some Samsungs (cell reception used to be a real strong point for Moto).Unlike most top-tier phones, it has an SD card holder (as well as a physical micro-SIM holder).  So you can add another half a terabyte (512GB) of storage for $20, if you like.  Eat your heart out, iPhone users.  According to Moto, it can take up to 1 TB (1024 GB).TL/DR: I would say this phone does everything well (of the things it does), without doing anything brilliantly, except battery life.

It loses WiFi connectivity almost daily and sometimes multiple times a day.  Other devices on the same network are not experiencing any connectivity issues.  Only Moto G 5G loses network connection for 1-4 minutes at a time.  A quick Google search shows that it may not be an uncommon issue.  I will try to do some more troubleshooting to determine if it is related to WiFi frequency (2.4 vs 5GHz).  Either way, rather disappointing.  Changing overall rating from 3.5 to 2 stars. Overall, the phone is a good value.  Realistically, I think it is 3.5 stars and since I have to go with a whole star rating scale, I am giving it a \"4\".It seems to be a good budget phone.  I had to upgrade due to an ancient version of Android on my old phone and very limited memory.  The days of having an option to move apps to an SD card are long gone and 32GB of memory just doesn't work when OS takes up almost 15GB.Let's move on to the things that matter:- The Good  - Battery seems to last for a long time with an average usage pattern (easily 2-3 days).  Yes, the phone is being used primarily as a communication device (voice calls, SMS and email messaging).  Occasional video playback around 30% of the time.  - It is responsive and very fast on WiFi and 5G (big red) network.- The \"Different\"  - It is big and bulky.  I have upgraded from 5.2\" to 6.6\" screen.  The screen is significantly larger, but the phone itself is thicker, too.  One hand operation is no longer an option and definitely not practical.  - The display is brighter but for some reason seems blurry.  I cannot find a comfortable balance between screen sharpness and brightness.  I tried different display settings but I am still searching for the perfect (or even acceptable) balance.- The camera  - Image quality is good for occasional use.  I am not a professional content creator and find it good enough.The phone was on sale and my impulse buying urge took the better of me.  Am I disappointed?  No, not really.  I read the specs and for the most part I knew what I was getting into.  However,  if anyone is considering Moto G, take a look at Moto G Power.  It seems to have a better display (at least on paper) and maybe a better overall product/value for a few more dollars (at the time of this review).","helpfulVotes":10},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Very happy with my phone.","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2025","body":"I'm good with it.

At first I thought this doesn't have thumb print, but does.","date":"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2024","body":"Solid phone, camera is decent. The only time I've noticed the 1600x720p screen having a issue is when I'm watching youtube videos. If you go on Netflix or another streaming app it look absolutely fine. I recently had a big issue with the company I was with changing prices. So I started doing some research, and started looking into unlocked phones. They seem to be somewhat older cellphones and pricier than usual. This Motorola is somewhat of a downgrade from the phone I had. Biggest difference being previous phone had a 1080p screen, gorilla glass, and crazy stupid fast charging. But, I couldn't change to a different cell company due to the android I had was not unlocked. That's what brought me here. I've had this phone for about a week, and I'm happy with it. I had a Motorola cell like 5-6 years ago, and one of my favorite features is the karate chop flashlight feature. Twist camera feature is handy too. It's nice to have that back again. I took some pictures of plants. The 48MP camera pics looked really good to me. I grew up on tube TV's, and VHS tapes, so the barley noticeable lower resolution screen doesn't bother me at all. If your a cell phone connoisseur this might not be the best phone for you. For the price though and the freedom to pretty much chose any company you want, I think this phone is a great deal. Oh, and the new cell phone company was able to activate this phone right away zero issues. I paid full price for a new one, but at the time I'm typing this there's a used one on here for $100. I wish I would've snatched that. Do your homework and check all the specs.","helpfulVotes":9},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    works but small issue","date":"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2024","body":"I like the phone and it works good.

I popped in my SIM card and it worked. Pretty good deal for $150. As for the phone itself, compared to my 7 year old midrange phone that just went kaput on me, it's pretty decent. The only thing I don't like about it is it is an ad machine full of ads galore. Another thing I don't like is it comes loaded with bloatware and apps I will never ever use. It's going to take a couple of weeks (tinkering with it sporadically) to get it set up the way I want it. But like I said, $150 is good deal. My wireless provider charges nearly 4 times price for the same phone. Let's see if I can get 7 years of use out of this one.","helpfulVotes":16},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":3,"title":"3.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    i expected better performance","date":"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025","body":"I do understand this is a cheap phone, i am i not comparing it with a 800+ device.

Updating, restarting, updating, restarting.The side fingerprint sensor is awkward for me.The device feels slow to me, probably because of all the extra apps is has running all the time.Camera is pitiful.It freezes sometimes.

I can;t figure out how to do that on my device so I went back to the same Motorola agent, who told me to search for \"wifi calling\" under settings.  I told her there was no result.  She said that means my carrier didn't enable it.  I said I am pretty sure Mint has done whatever they could to becuz the Mint agent stayed with me for about an hour and went through all the possible steps (checked IMEI numbers, reset mobile networks, turn airplane mode on and off, etc ) with me, so the problems is with the device.  But the motorola agent just repeated the same thing AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN:  GO TO YOUR CARRIER.

I have to say that this is the first time that I have purchased a new phone and not been thrilled with it. The phone just seems glitchy; for instance when I open my gmail even though I am holding the phone in portrait position in my hand, it opens in landscape. Not the end of the world, but when you start adding up little things like this it starts to get annoying.The Moto G Power 5G does have some things that I like. The fast charging is a plus, if it had battery life to go with it it would be great but the battery lasts a day at best.The screen is very bright and the adjustment is all or nothing, just a really bright screen that doesn't dim very well.The phone is big and clunky feeling in my hand - kind of uncomfortable to hold. You'd think they would have tried to make the design a bit more ergonomic.The fingerprint sensor on the power button is annoying, I had to use my ring finger so that I wasn't turning on the phone Everytime I picked it up.I'm not really thrilled with this phone. Seeing how it is only going to get one system upgrade I will probably get something else by the end of the year.It does get a 5g signal - it does that good, but the rest of the phone doesn't warrant paying what they are asking.

She uses only a few apps and basic features, but she is physically hard on phones and ends up needing a new one every couple of years, regardless of the brand.

What can I say -- it's a modern Android phone with everything she needs and more, and I feel better knowing that I didn't spend have to spend a ton. It may not have the brightest and sharpest screen, AI tools, or other flagship bells and whistles, but she doesn't need any of that.I also considered getting her the Galaxy A35, but I decided on this Motorola because of the rubbery back material, which will be better for her than glass.The pale lilac is more a pale pink than lilac.

My old Moto G7 had started shutting off and I had never liked the tinny sounding audio it had, so after 4 years decided on this Moto G 5G 2023. The box had previously been unsealed and opened which I expected since it was advertised as ' used like new '.I ordered the 'Ink Blue' color.The phone I received is a  very very dark gray or black with subtle sparkle or metallic appearance. It seems to be the Black Mineral color, although the box it came in is labeled as 'Ink Blue'. The invoice states it is ' Ink Blue '.The charger that is advertised as in the box is missing. The charge cord did come in the box.This phone gets hot! I played a couple YouTube music vids on it and the phone actually got hot and vibrated from the music.I guess I misunderstood what they meant by ' used like new '.Even though I ordered the Ink Blue phone and received a Black phone, I probably could have kept it even though the adapter was missing, but I am afraid to use this phone as it gets hot so I sent it back.I've ordered several phones from Amazon in the past and only ever had one problem.
