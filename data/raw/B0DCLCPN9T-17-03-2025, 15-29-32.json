Yes, it was time. Bought this phone unlocked, followed the instructions in the Smart Switch app and easily transferred my stuff from the old to new phone pretty seamlessly. Thrilled. A couple of apps were outdated versions, so I had to manually fill  in info but, other than that, that evening I was using my new phone as another computer and really enjoying exploring the phone and all the AI offerings. I called my cell carrier the next day and transferred my number to my new phone. It took approximate 5 minutes. This phone is large  but, like anything else, you get used to it. Functions are seamless, charge lasts almost 2 days for me, camara is decent, charges quickly, screen is clear, and the AI functions are fun. Very happy with this purchase and the whole experience with it.  It is March 8, 2025 and I can confidently recommend this phone.","helpfulVotes":7},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    A very nice phone for the price.","date":"Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2025","body":"This Samsung Galaxy S24 FE cell phone is a  very nice looking phone. I am coming into this phone from only using track phones so it will be time before I can say very good or whatever.I will say it charges fast, I bought the Samsung corded fast charger and within an hour of first plugging it in it was fully charged. I used the phone two days before it was down to 40% on the battery then I charged it again.  I bought this phone so I could use a company like straight talk (unlocked) but it would not be accepted by their system. I found another pay as you go company called cricket that I am using now and the phone is working great. I have also used it to learn to text via a friend in AZ. I also purchased a cover for the phone too to help protect it if I should drop the thing.  I will add more later to this if I can after I have used it for a while. I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a nice phone for a not terrible price. I believe I got my moneys worth.  One more thing to add I purchased the 256Gb storage as well, just to have alot of space for whatever.","helpfulVotes":23},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    This is a well-rounded and beautifully crafted phone with excellent overall performance.","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2025","body":"I’m a Samsung fan from China, and because this particular model isn’t available in the Chinese market, I decided to purchase it through Amazon when I saw a great deal. I’ve always preferred Samsung over domestic Chinese brands due to my dissatisfaction with their user experience — ugly UI icons, buggy system settings, and clunky designs. When I received the phone, I carefully powered it on, set it up, and after using it for a bit, I was really impressed. The transition was seamless since I’m so familiar with Samsung’s One UI system. The camera takes stunningly clear photos, and the design is beautiful, sleek, and stylish. Samsung is, and always will be, my number one choice for smartphones.","helpfulVotes":9},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Good phone overall","date":"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2024","body":"The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE offers great value for its price. It performs well in most areas, but there are a few things to keep in mind.Pros:Camera and Video: The camera setup delivers impressive photos and videos, especially for the price range. You get vibrant colors and sharp details that are perfect for everyday use.Overall Performance: It handles daily tasks and multitasking smoothly, making it a solid choice for casual users.Battery life: AMAZING.Cons:Heating Issues: With heavy usage, the phone tends to heat up, especially during gaming or extended camera use. It's manageable but worth noting.Build: While the design is sleek, the device feels a bit fragile. I highly recommend buying a durable case and screen protector as soon as you get it.","helpfulVotes":59},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Love my phone!","date":"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2025","body":"I've only had the phone 2 days but so far it's great. The battery is great. The picture is bright and clear. Everything down loads lightning fast. I haven't really used the camera yet but I'd be willing to bet that it's wonderful too.","helpfulVotes":2},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Best Phone I've Owned To Date","date":"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2024","body":"I was a little apprehensive in buying a phone that wasn't connected directly to my phone carrier.  However as my current phone is coming to the end of it's life (swollen battery split the phone open) and there were some good Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals going on I thought I'd take the chance in trying to buy a phone non-traditionally outside of my phone carrier.On the Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals, Amazon had the best deal on this phone I could find.  My carrier had this phone available as a Black Friday deal for $2/month but required being locked down in a 3 year installment plan/contract.  These days I'm not a fan of being locked down in longterm contracts for phone service.  Plus to get this phone for the discount through my carrier they would have pushed me out of my grandfathered unlimited service plan which gives me the MAX app premium service for free into a new unlimited plan which would take that away.  Amazon was also selling this phone for about $175 cheaper compared to what the list price was on my carrier's website for buying this phone without a contract/installment agreement so again the better deal.As far as the phone is concerned, I find it to be truly amazing.  I'm not the kind of guy to get caught up in the pageantry or the gimmicks of a phone.  I'm a basic text, call and play a game here or there kind of phone user.  Maybe a take a pic or two if something catches my eye so I definitely won't use this phone in ways that many will.  This is also the reason why I went for the FE model over the standard and premium versions of this phone because simply I don't need all the extras that comes with the other models.  Still as the least expensive model in the line up, it packs some robust features and many steps ahead of the phone it replaces (S10e).  I've only been using this phone for a couple weeks now and feel like I'm still on a learning curve about the new functions and features but I can say it's the nicest and best phone I've owned to date.I give it an astonishing 5.0/5.0 rating for a perfect 5 stars!!!","helpfulVotes":23},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Samsung Galaxy S24 FE has flagship specs without the flagship pr","date":"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2025","body":"I upgraded from the Motorola Moto G Power 2020 to the Galaxy S24 FE which is my first Samsung phone. I upgraded to the Galaxy S24 FE because of the 7 years of software and security patch updates. I was tired of every 2 - 3 years of having to get a new phone because the phones I had were no longer being updated. They were slowing down and starting to freeze up after 2 - 3 years. From all the reviews I've watched on YouTube most reviewers say the Galaxy S24 FE is almost like getting the flagship Galaxy S24 Plus for half the price. I like how fast and responsive the S24 FE is plus it has really great cameras that take some really great pictures. The S24 FE also has great features. I got the S24 FE November 25,2024 and I'm still learning new things about the phone. If you want a phone with flagship specs without paying a flagship price I highly recommend you buy the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE.","helpfulVotes":35},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Good phone for right price.","date":"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2024","body":"This works mostly well. Not as much bloatware as Samsung used to have. Most of the AI stuff is gimmicky and locked behind a Samsung account. And may soon need a subscription to use. There are many “features” that are just redundant. You can have apps on the main screen, have apps in the app drawer and then there is the side panel that you can hide apps but accessing the side panel takes a swipe to the left which also means you can just place the apps on another Home Screen that would take the same amount of time to access, so why? I guess options are good. The bad part is browsing webpages using the installed browsers. Some embedded content on some sites just would not load. Which is strange. The camera is ok. Maybe at half the original price this phone is good but definitely not worth the full asking price.","helpfulVotes":11},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Better than my S23 Ultra","date":"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024","body":"I have a Samsung S23 ultra(see the reflection of it used to take the pictures)that I bought brand new upon release and I've never hated a phone like the S23 Ultra I have. The screen is too big and very unresponsive at the center of the screen while the edges are extremely responsive at slight touch of the palm of my small hand. It's also lagging compared to my S10+ and the powerful camera is uselessly blurry because it takes too long to AI which is supposed to help-focus. I also find the phone battery to drain faster than my S10+ and the Wifi, Bluetooth connection cut off from time to time. The S23 ultra brightness bar is also badly designed compared to the S10+(you can't slowly increase or decrease the brightness on the S23 Ultra like it is on the S10+. A slight slide of the S23 Ultra brightness bar increases or decrease the brightness too much making you waste time trying to find the right middle. The same goes when you want to move the cursor between characters of a text or sms on S23 Ultra. It jumps from c|haracter1 to chara|cter5 when all you wanted was to move the cursor to cha|racter3).It might be that my S23 Ultra has a screen defect and I should've returned it but I didn't. Now I bought this cheaper S24 FE and transferred all my data to it and I swear to God; I'm loving it❤️.The S24 Fe small size is so good in my average man hands and the screen is very responsive with screen protector. The 90° not-round edges are good because my palm doesn't touch the screen while I'm typing. It also has a better camera focus and the brightness bar is not increasing or decreasing a lot with slight slides like it is with the S23 Ultra.The Wifi and Bluetooth connections are also better on the S24 Fe. I still can't believe I spent more than twice the price of this S24 Fe when I bought the S23 Ultra and the S23 Ultra doesn't even have something special that I like and use except the camera that can zoom 10x but is uselessly blurry 2 times out of 3.In summary, everything on the S24 Fe is to my taste \"better\" than the S23 Ultra except the camera zoom which is 10x zoom on the S23 Ultra and 3x zoom on the S24 Fe.Update(12/09/24): While my S24 Fe battery drains slower than my S23 Ultra, its fast charge is a lot slower than the S23 Ultra. I expected the way around because the S23 Ultra has a bigger battery(it might be because I have too many apps on the S23 Ultra which drains battery faster but it doesn't make any sense to me that the S23 Ultra that drains battery faster is also charging faster).I also dislike that Samsung is forcing us to use the new 6-PIN lock on new phones in order to get the option of unlocking your phone by typing your 6 digit PIN without pressing the OK button. On my S23 Utra, when I type my PIN code 1234(example of pin), it unlocks. On S24 Fe, I have to typing 123456 to unlock it. If you use a pin code like 1234 on S24 Fe, you must also press OK to unlock. A small detail but very annoying if you're using your phone as an Uber/Lyft driver where you need to keep your eyes on a busy road while typing a longer PIN code. I had to remove the PIN because I almost had an accident because I'm not used to 6 digits PIN. I'd rather get this cheap phone and data stolen than dying into an accident.","helpfulVotes":18},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    It has drawbacks","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025","body":"I always buy Samsung Galaxy phones. This phone has many useful features. However, there are drawbacks. The 3 camera lenses protrude from the back by 1/8 inch and the extreme smoothness of the glass back reduces friction that would keep the phone in the table. I had more than one instance where my phone slid off the table. I was able to find a very well-designed phone-back case by OtterBox that increased the friction with the table while simultaneously making the back of the phone flat so that the lenses do not protrude from the case. This phone includes \"Circle To Search\" AI which allows you to copy text. However, this AI feature has a drawback. Sometimes the AI doesn't copy the text exactly. I have had instances where it modifies what is there. That makes no sense. This feature, despite the minor drawback, has great utility. I was able to use the magnifier App to copy an activation code from my TV screen.","helpfulVotes":1},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Flagship Experience","date":"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2024","body":"The Samsung FE (fan edition) phones are meant to give customers a flagship phone experience at a more reasonable price, making some strategic compromises to make that happen.  I think they succeeded for the most part with the S24 FE.The display and camera are the two key factors in phone quality, in my opinion.  The display here is an FHD+ (basically 1080p) 6.7\" AMOLED, which is the same size as the S24+ with a lower resolution.  The AMOLED gives great response timea and black levels and the lower resolution is not very important to overall image quality.  I am impressed for the price.Photo quality is excellent and similar to the S24+, with particularly impressive 4K60 video quality.  It can also record 8K30 if you want to have some room for cropping.  I normally go with Google phones, and it is a close competition.  I think the Pixels do a better job in low light and have more vivid colors with default settings.  The AI tools are fun to play with, but feel very early.  I don't see a generative function that allows you to type in things to fill selected areas with, but I may be missing it.The chipset is notably slower than the S24+, which is not very relevant in my usage so far.  This is still a capable 2024 exynos and able to handle demanding apps and multitasking.  It may not last as many years without becoming outdated.This is my first Samsung and I was happy to see it was not stuffed with intrusive Samsung apps I may not prefer over other apps.  The Samsung AI for things like translation is cool and the phone also comes with Google AI for things like circle to search.  With that, you can point your camera at anything in the phone app, hold the home button down, then circle something to search for it.  It works remarkably well and better than any AI tool I have used before.  Everyone I've shown it to was blown away.Without a case, the phone feels like an oiled up brick that tries to slip from my hands.  With a case, that is solved and, while a little clunky, is not bad to hold for long periods.Overall, this is an excellent phone that achieves the goal of giving a flagship experience.","helpfulVotes":46},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Price of a Phone","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2025","body":"I am enjoying this phone so far, I just do not understand why they have removed the headset jack and to take a picture of a text is so cumbersome when using the volume down and the side button simultaneously. Thank goodness it has the palm swipe feature because this makes capturing text much easier.  Also, finding the recyle bin can be a bit confusing.

I love the Secure Folder functionality that gives you absolute security, with all security it can be inconvenient at times but I don't care I think it is worth it.  Also I found that you are able to turn off 2G data something that we really don't need in the US and allows for unencrypted communication and easy high jacking if you connect to a fake cell tower.

We paid a lot of money for Samsung's flagship phones and they just kept getting worse and worse, so I resisted, but finally our S9s had to go.  True the features like the screen resolution, isn't as good on the FE phone as it was on our old S9, and it's not a Snapdragon processor, but that hasn't been an issue at all.  In fact, we hadn't even noticed.  Upgrading was a piece of cake and along with a nice Samsung case, these phones have been great.My only regret is I'm told the S25s are coming out in a month and had we held off, we would have had a better deal or been able to purchase a newer model.

If you are switching from another phone, simply put your existing Sim card into the new phone and it should work. If not, purchase the sim card kit from straight talk. The picture quality is great!

This new phone is a bit bigger in size, but honestly it didn't bother me as much as I was concerned about originally. I really liked the s21fe's size, but this slightly bigger phone has won me over since getting it.Definitely Recommend this phone, it does everything I need it to do and probably more! grab the 256gb version if its what you need storage wise, I'm still doing good with 128gb.","helpfulVotes":14},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    estoy descubriendo todas sus posibilidades","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2025","body":"Es lo que buscaba"},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Good phone","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2025","body":"Does exactly what I need for a phone."},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Very secure","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2025","body":"Protects phone as expected"},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Less for more money!","date":"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025","body":"Overall a decent phone.

I feel like I have a high-end phone without the higher price tag of the Ultra. I went ahead and turned on all the bells and whistles (AI, Google Assistant) and am having fun learning more about how to use those.  I haven't tried the real time translation feature, but I will at some point. The transfer from my old to new phone was seamless. I did a tech support chat with my provider (Verizon) though to swtitch to an eSIM since the SIM in my old phone was a different size than what is supported on the 24 FE. That text chat went quickly, and my phone was up and running with all my previous apps and data.","helpfulVotes":2},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Love Galaxy S Phones","date":"Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2025","body":"A great quality phone.

The seemless user interface and sleek design is absolutely captivating. From 10 percent, the phone will take 4 hours to charge if you have a regular adapter. It will hold a charge for a great amount of time. Pairs very well with Echo Buds, which I also highly recommend for audiophiles who look for balance between their music and their surroundings. The phone does come alone, without the promo for the $100 gift card, so double check your cart to make sure you chose the correct option.Update on having the phone for two months:This one of the best phones out there! The functionality is superb. However, it can heat up when fast charging and when using a couple of high functioning apps at a time. Fast charge take an hour and a half. The phone does not slow down, but the heat makes the phone a little uncomfortable to hold after, even with a case.","helpfulVotes":53},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    A24 Samsung phone.","date":"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025","body":"A quality phone.

That said, I don't see much of a difference to justify the price. Yeah, the Samsung is a bit more refined and some nice features (better camera of course) but there are a couple things that I really don't like. First, I have to tap the screen twice to wake it up even though I have the setting to wake if I handle the phone. The Motorola wakes just fine with the slightest touch. Second, the finger print sensor is at times hard to see, so sometimes it takes too long to get into my apps. The Motorola has a dedicated finger print hole that worked much better.
