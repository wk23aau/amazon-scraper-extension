I got this phone when it told me it was coming in, when I received the phone it had minimal scratches on the chassis and a slight scuff on the bottom right which is no problem for me as I use a case. The screen was in almost perfect condition I see little to no scratches and no cracks or anything. It is also the original screen, the battery is great I got mine with 79% which isn’t great but it lasts me the whole day and more which is more than enough. If you don’t know which color to get the blue is great I love this blue, also the cameras are amazing especially at night. It came with a power cord which works, but the power brick it came with doesn’t work which isn’t the end of the world for me as I have others. In the end I say that this phone refurbished is great and I would definitely recommend.","helpfulVotes":5},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Excellent Product and Service","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2025","body":"I usually don’t leave reviews. I also have never purchased a refurbished item and was super wary on doing so. When the phone arrived, I was impressed that it truly was in excellent condition as stated. No scratches nowhere and the battery life is incredible. My old phone I’d have to keep it plugged in because it would die within an hour after using it. I went almost the ENTIRE day with Spotify playing in the background while I worked and my battery life remained strong and full where I didn’t need to plug in my phone for a recharge. Incredible!! I’m over the moon with happiness over this phone.When I received my phone and my husband helped me set it up, I couldn’t get it to accept calls and SOS remained on. It was showing it wasn’t compatible with my carrier so I reached out to the seller and received a response immediately. He helped me look into it and it turns out I inputted an incorrect number into the compatibility section on the website of my carrier. The seller walked me through next steps and told me to connect with my carrier. We did so and got everything taken care of. The seller had even said to let him know how it goes. He went ABOVE and BEYOND what I’d anticipated I’d get as a response. Truly remarkable service. We have more phones to buy for my family (my husband & our teenage kids). My in laws plan to do the same and but refurbished. We will only go through this seller because I trust him and trust I get what is listed as far as the condition goes. I also trust that if there’s an issue he will make it rightThe phone was unlocked as well as stated in the description.Overall - This was a great experience and I received the quality phone as described.","helpfulVotes":13},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Good value for the price","date":"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2025","body":"I needed a quick, reliable phone to replace my XR. The product arrived in good condition, some minor scratches on the edges, but nothing unexpected. The screen looks great, the back is decent, and the charging works well. The battery seems average; I haven't used it enough to fully assess, but it went from 97% to 90% overnight. Functionality is solid, the camera is excellent, and the shipping was fast, it arrived earlier than expected.","helpfulVotes":22},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Great Value for a Like-New iPhone!","date":"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025","body":"I recently purchased the renewed Apple iPhone 12, 128GB, Black, and I am thoroughly impressed with the quality and performance of this device.  First off, the phone arrived in pristine condition with no visible scratches or marks—it truly looks and feels brand-new. The packaging was secure, and all accessories included were functional and clean. Setting up the phone was a breeze, and it worked perfectly with my carrier, thanks to it being fully unlocked.  Performance-wise, the iPhone 12 is as fast and reliable as expected. Apps run smoothly, the camera quality is stunning, and the battery life is impressive for a renewed device. The 128GB storage is more than enough for my apps, photos, and videos.  This purchase offers excellent value for anyone looking to upgrade without paying the full price for a new model. I highly recommend this renewed iPhone to anyone wanting quality, reliability, and savings in one package!","helpfulVotes":28},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Great Phone.","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2025","body":"The phone I received is in great condition, hardly a mark on it. I was worried about that, because it's like a roll of the dice not seeing the actual item you are purchasing. The battery life is at 86%, which is okay with me, I am used to that, I dealt with that with my older phone. So overall, I am very pleased with this seller. It was totally worth it for me.","helpfulVotes":3},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Worth every penny :)","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2025","body":"This phone is nearly perfect! No scratches or cracks, came with a charger but no brick for it, and super easy to set up! Came in shiny and looks brand new. The battery life is even at 100% which I know some people in the reviews say otherwise. I would highly recommend getting one from amazon because i think it’s worth it.","helpfulVotes":8},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":3,"title":"3.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Unresponsive Customer Service and 83% battery life","date":"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2025","body":"The iPhone was in very nice cosmetic condition and came with a screen guard.  The reason I'm giving three stars is because the battery life is at 83%.  I've never had one of my prior brand new phones run down to 83% and I had an iPhone X that I used A LOT for 6 years (and I have a 6s that still has 100%).  The second reason I'm giving three stars is because I wrote to the seller to ask if there was something they could do (swap out or give a partial refund) and they never responded and it's been several weeks now.  Other than worrying how much life this phone has left in it, it's a good phone.  I'd just have expected an Amazon renewed product to come with a decent battery life.","helpfulVotes":13},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Decent phone but plenty of food for thought!","date":"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2025","body":"It appeared to be in decent condition.  One small scratch on the screen and a chip of black off the side.  I paid the price for the phone to be in excellent condition and to me it didn’t justify that.  The frustrating part was the packaging, no iPhone box at all and no power plug.  The most frustrating past was that the phone was restored to factory settings which I expected, but the phone was in accessibility mode when I first booted up.  I did a little research to correct that being none of the on screen menus were responding.  Any regular person would have returned the phone.  Just giving my honest opinion in hopes that they can improve on the quality and starting condition of the phone.","helpfulVotes":4},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Great quality, and customer service!","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2024","body":"For starters; the price on these phones is great. Between having the reassurance of Amazon buyer protection, and the benefit of knowing the device has been tested for performance, it’s well worth it.I needed a new phone fast after my cat knocked mine  into the sink ☹️ Rice fixed it for a while, but it was only temporary before it died altogether.I hate buying phones and avoid it whenever possible. 99% of mine belonged to someone in my family first. And i was good with that. Needless to say, my cat didn’t wait for someone in my family to upgrade. I was on my own this time.Okay.... that’s not entirely true. My grandma had an iPhone 7 sitting around so that held me over in the meantime. Going from an iPhone 11 Pro Max to an iPhone 7 was….bad. It was too dam small, in every possible way.  32 gigs of memory!! I needed an upgrade. Fast. My 11 year old was bullying me relentlessly. And that’s on me. They had my old XR (formerly my dad’s)I scoured FB marketplace. I’d decided upgrade a little, so I could feel better about the switch.  I didn’t want to feel backed me into a corner by my cat’s recklessness. I would get a slightly newer model in a fun colour.Marketplace had plenty.  Sending message after message from my iPhone 7, I worried. “This person seems too eager”, “this one has been posted so long”, “I want a purple, but the only purple one listed has less storage space” and “the pretty green one has a small crack”, “this guy lives 2 hours from me” and “Battery life? Errr last time I checked it was like 74%?….no, I can’t take a screenshot of it, it’s turned off”…. “cash only please” Etc.So much pressure. What happens if the thing doesn’t work? That’s $300+ down the drain. I knew I couldn’t afford new. But I hated the idea of buying something used from a stranger on Facebook. I didn’t want to get scammed, and I also didn’t want to settle.That’s when I remembered good ol’ Amazon. Maybe I’d check there. Just for funsies. Probably out of my budget, but it couldn’t hurt.Sure enough, refurbished devices selling “like new!” Mostly same cost or less than what I’d found so far. Surely there was a catch? I read through everything, tested by Amazon, includes all the specs, unlocked, I can pick the colour, the storage size, the condition, etc. AND I could have it delivered to me tomorrow??! With a warranty?!!I recovered from my brief stint of disappointment after learning the 12’s don’t come in yellow. Then fought hard to decide between mint and lavender. The lavender would take an extra day to arrive. Mint it was!! As promised, it arrived the next day. It was in beautiful shape. 128g’s, mint green, not a single scratch, 86% battery life. All for less than I would have paid to some stranger for a 64g with some “small scratches”Once my case and screen protector arrived I excitedly set it up and synced my data.Oh no.The FACE ID DIDNT WORK 😭After becoming used to facial recognition, having that yanked away, and dealing with a 7 for over 2 weeks—  I was desperate for the convenience of Face ID. I had been using my fingerprint. Like a *caveman*.Not to mention I have Blink 182 tickets, and it specifically states facial recognition is required to access the mobile tickets. Idk if that’s true, but I needed Face ID!!I googled, I contacted apple support. Fixing it could be upwards of $300. That’s almost what I paid for the whole phone!!I realllllly didn’t want to be stuck without a phone again. But I also wanted one fully functioning.So I reached out to Amazon support and explained. The rep was incredibly helpful (as most Amazon reps are) and after bts failed, she advised the ship was a 3rd party seller, and she  send a message to them. “If they don’t fix it by (insert date) contact us back and we’ll make this right” she encouraged.I’m ngl. I was nervous. I didn’t have high hopes, having dealt with 3p sellers on Amazon in the past. At least Amazon had my back, ig. The concert wasn’t till July. Even without facial recognition, it was loads better than the  7. I could make do in the meantime.The seller came in clutch though, and my worry was unwarranted. They responded within minutes. They were receptive, apologetic, and more than willing to help.As I’d anticipated, they offered a refund or exchange, as soon as they received the return. I explained my concern with not having a phone for several days or more; and the merchant offered to overnight a replacement as soon as the return was dropped off.I could deal with one day without a phone! I gratefully accepted. That was Saturday night, we made plans to catch up Monday for the return instructions and for them to overnight it.Monday I reached back out; and they were ready to ship, BUT they *had no more green….* 🫢 SHOCK“…do you have purple”No. :( just blue, white, and black.THIS WAS A HUGE BUMMER.It’s silly I know, and the definition of *first world problems “.. but I mean…. My change of heart about this whole phone thing HINGED ON THE FUN COLOUR. Without it, I was just a person…out $350… because my cat was thirsty while I was watching YouTube while washing dishes. I needed a cool colour. Plus,  I’d already gotten the matching case! Clear with mint green borders.It wasn’t even a fun blue… it was a dark, serious, navy blue. It was pretty and classy, but I wanted something fun. I even asked if he had any older models in yellow 😭😭 no luck,They told me they’d be restocking in a day or so. Still, no greens or purples came in.Ugh. Reality was setting in. I was going to have to settle. It was fine, I thought. At least it would be a fully functioning phone.No. I wasn’t ready to let go. They assured me I could take my time to decide, and I asked if we could wait another week in case one came in. If it didn’t, *then* I would choose from the options available.I messaged them Wednesday afternoon, bracing myself for the answer…. THEY GOT IN PURPLE! YAY.They sent a label, I dropped it off, sent a photo, and had my new phone the next morning.they’d said overnight shipping… but wow! I’d dropped off the return around 3pm, and had the replacement by noon the next day. I didn’t even have my new case yet 😅Despite the Barney-Esque colour scheme my mint green case created, the lavender is GORGEOUS and I’m actually sort of glad the green didn’t work out.Don’t get me wrong, the green is also  gorgeous.. but in the end I’m glad I ended up with the lavender. I was overjoyed when I was prompted to set Face ID during setup. Worked brilliantly, as did everything else.Great packaging, no cosmetic flaws, amazing battery life, customer service was great, and best of all… ITS PURPLE!Can’t wait to pair it with the new case. I’m so glad I went this route where I have some peace of mind as a buyer.I’m grateful to the seller for being so helpful and patient with me as insufferable as I must have seemed making such a fuss over colour preferenceIf you’re nervous buying a phone used or refurbished too, hopefully you can take comfort in knowing- this seller is legit. You receive a good quality product, and, speaking from experience, they’ll gladly help resolve any issues you may run into.","helpfulVotes":490},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Definitely worth the money!","date":"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2025","body":"I waited a full 8 days before writing a review. I ordered premium refurbished. And honestly, the phone is basically brand new.I purchased an iPhone 12 back in 2021. It has lasted me up until now actually. Front and back screen are both busted, speakers are sucky but they are probably just dirty. I put a tempered glass protector on it and gave it to my 6 year old to play Minecraft on. My point in saying that is the iPhone 12 has served me so well that I purchased pretty much the same phone. Just purple. I see no point in buying the newest number iPhone. I needed to replace my busted on after 4 years of owning it and was confused enough to not stray far at all from the trusty 12.I would recommend getting this. If you are like me and frugal, want your moneys worth etc, just get the premium version that way you know for sure it’ll be in very good shape! I was too worried I’d get scammed buying from FB marketplace and too cheap to buy brand new. And I’m glad I went with this option!Oh and I see many people complain about the battery life but this one’s battery max capacity is at 93%. Whereas my old iPhone 12 that I bought 4 years ago brand new was at 80%. Full charge lasts me pretty much all day! Speakers are VERY loud that I can’t watch any videos at max volume, and the screen brightness is perfect! Also it’s purple. And as Bella says in Twilight, “Purples cool.”I’d post photos and videos but I’m writing this review from the phone. Not a single scratch, dent, or crack on this!"},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    OLED Flicker is Very Annoying","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025","body":"I've grown to like this device a lot despite the absence of a physical home button. I transition to this one from an iPhone 8 Plus (only because that one is like, not receiving updates anymore), and it was a bit jarring at first, but I got used to using this new one after like a month. right out of the box the screen and metal shell were in really good condition with only one scratch on the upper right of the casing. The screen is perfectly responsive even through a protective screen and all the haptics/gestures work perfectly. One thing that this device does that I really don't like, is that it has had this weird flicker whenever the screen is very dark or black. this iPhone has been doing this since the day I received it, and initially I thought nothing of it; then I remembered that my old iPhone doesnt do this at all.. I don't know what it is, but it's very odd and at times interferes with some of the ways I use the device.  I opted not to return it because other people I know who have this version of iPhone said their phone did that at some point too and they either ignored it or they updated their device and the problem resolved itself. I had to remember that this is a used handset and this issue with how it handles black is literally one of two faults that the item has. The vender was pretty meticulous with support, packaging, instructions, and they even included a new charger in the box that works very well and is a bit thicker than the OEM parts so it's still in good shape too.I think it was worth keeping overall, but will still wonder about this flicker for the duration of the time that I use this iPhone.","helpfulVotes":1},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Overall fine, but battery health not as promised","date":"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2025","body":"I’ve only just finished set up and tested some features. So far camera works, keypad works, I’m satisfied with the physical appearance and the shipping was fast as promised. HOWEVER, in both the item description (as a premium condition phone) and on the certified premium checklist card included in the box with phone, it is promised to have a phone battery capacity of “over 90%” though the battery health measurement in the phone settings states 83%. I’m not dissatisfied enough with that alone to return, but I would hope anyone reading reviews sees this and knows that the promise of anything close to 90% is not a valid promise. In hindsight, I’d likely take my chances with the standard quality option and not spend the extra money on premium. I have a feeling it’s the same phone quality standard either way and you’re just paying more for verbiage with premium."},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Good to Go!","date":"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2025","body":"minus one star only because the charging cord described in the listing was not included.  however, my ipad cord and plug worked just fine.Like others, I was a little hesitant.

To say the least I’m pleasantly surprised. The phone is flawless and works perfectly. Transferred everything from the old phone effortlessly. Called my carrier and transferred my number, also effortlessly. I’ve been testing it out for a while now and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with this phone.

The phone boasts an improved camera system with AI-driven enhancements, capturing stunning 4K video. Compared to my previous iPhone SE, the iPhone 12 delivers noticeably sharper and superior video quality.Although the phone arrived later than expected, I'm pleased with the purchase overall. This is the third phone I've bought through Amazon, and the first one that worked as expected. The first two were not authorized for service in the USA. Based on my experience, I recommend Amazon’s Renewed cell phone program for those looking to reduce waste by recycling and reusing electronics. However, the phone arrived with a few dents and messy adhesive, which took some effort to clean off using rubbing alcohol.Shipping could have been faster, and I experienced a delay of about a week and a half before receiving the phone. I also wish Amazon would disclose the seller associated with your purchase before you buy, as some sellers provide better products than others. Fortunately, this particular seller did a great job renewing the phone.The 256 GB of storage is a huge plus, leaving me with about 64 GB free after setup. It also came with a charger cable, but unfortunately, there was no official product manual, AirPods, or original box included.If you don’t mind waiting and a bit of uncertainty, Amazon’s renewed phones tend to work out well thanks to their generous guarantee and return policy. It would be great, however, if refunds for defective purchases were processed more quickly. Lastly, Siri on this model feels different compared to my iPhone SE, likely because I don’t have the hardware needed to take full advantage of the new Apple Intelligence features on this device.This product meets my expectations and hardware tests thus far. The battery life is good, and I was able to use it for about all day without needing to plug it in.","helpfulVotes":37},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Works and looks great","date":"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025","body":"We purchased this for our daughter and it works great and is in great condition.The charger that came with it doesn't work and I was told a new charger couldn't be sent, the phone would have to be returned as well.

Here’s a breakdown of my thoughts:Performance: The A14 Bionic chip delivers impressive performance. Everything from browsing to gaming has been smooth and responsive. I’m glad I chose this model—I can easily multitask without any noticeable lag.Condition: The phone arrived in good condition overall, with minimal signs of wear. However, I did notice a few light scratches on the screen that weren’t mentioned in the description. While they don’t impact functionality, it was a bit disappointing.Camera Quality: The camera takes fantastic photos, and the Night Mode feature is a game-changer. I love capturing memories, and this phone does an excellent job, even in tricky lighting situations.Battery Life: The battery life is decent but could be better. I find myself needing to charge it by the end of the day, especially with heavy usage. It’s not a dealbreaker, but I was expecting a bit more endurance.Value for Money: Considering the savings compared to a brand-new device, this refurbished iPhone 12 offers great value. For anyone on a budget, it’s a solid option.In summary, I highly recommend the refurbished iPhone 12 for anyone looking for a reliable smartphone. Just be sure to check the condition carefully beforehand. Happy with my purchase overall!","helpfulVotes":42},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Highly Recommend","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2024","body":"I am a 19 year old broke college student, but I have had the Iphone XR since my freshman year of highschool... I am a rising junior now. Though my XR did my well over the years,  she recently started shutting off on me at random times, would die after 30 minutes of use after being charged fully. I was just wayyyy past due for a new phone, so I got this one. This was one of my first big girl purchases, so I was a little worried that something was going to be wrong with the phone, seeing as I saw quite a few reviews complaining of issues with their phones, but I haven't had any problems yet. Face ID works perfectly, extremely minor scratches (so unnoticeable I was only able to tell because I was strictly looking for them), easy to switch over to my carrier (literally just inserted the old sim card, and 30 minutes later EVERYTHING transferred over with no issues). Honestly, this is a REALLY good deal if you're looking for a more cheap route than having to buy a phone straight from Apple.Now, the only issue, which I dont fully see as an issue and youll understand why but the battery. The biggest issue with my old phone was how quickly it died. It was impossible to go out for longer than 3 hours without  my phone dying. The first setting I checked on the new phone was the battery capacity, and although I was really really upset when I saw it was also at 80% like my last phone, I dont really know if that number is fully true. I recieved my phone yesterday, and havent charged it since the afternoon of that day, and it is still on 49% which would NEVER happen with my old phone. SO, I put the rating down one star because it does still say that the battery capacity is 80%, but I just havent really seen that as of yet!Hope you guys found my review useful, and I highly HIGHLY recommend buying this product. Just make sure to double-check the ratings of the seller you're buying from. For me, the black color of the iPhone 12 came from a different buyer than the blue color. The black phone color seller has 3.2-star ratings while the blue phone seller has a 4.5-star rating, so I went with a color I wouldn't have usually gone with to higher my chances of receiving a phone in better condition!","helpfulVotes":22},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Scratches on the sides rims","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2025","body":"The phone is great besides the fact theirs scratches all on the sides and chipped paint"},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Works well","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2025","body":"It works ok.Not as clean as I thought it would be but gets the job done."},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I believe I received a brand new unit with zero battery cycles and battery was 100%","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2025","body":"The battery was 100% and no cycles so this appeared to be a new phone.

Then on December 14, almost exactly 2 months later, the audio on the phone app stopped working.  Suddenly I was like a mime with a phone.  If I did a video call, I'd have to perform interpretive dance.I'm a pretty fair tech geek.  After running complete diagnostics at home and at the Apple store, both on the software and hardware, it turned out to be a $250 hardware problem. This was most likely because when the the vendor swapped in a new (non-Apple) battery, they did not seat it correctly.To be fair, iPhone 12's are also known for having phone audio problems (muting audio weirdly.)  But after extensive diagnostics, as I said, it did turn out to be a hardware problem.  It seems to me that a refurbished phone should work longer than 2 months.  And usually, they do. Just not this one.Now, maybe I could have gone to the trouble of returning and replacing this phone, But even if they let me do that, who among us can be phone-less for a week?  Even if you bought the insurance coverage, you'd still be out the phone for that long.  Normally, I don't mind unplugging on nights or weekends, but I need my phone for work.  So, I paid the $250 to Apple to fix it in a couple of hours.You do you, but honestly, until the vendor addresses that problem, I would steer clear, especially if it's an iPhone 12. Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor.","helpfulVotes":22},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Great for gifting","date":"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2025","body":"I bought the excellent condition one and it turned to be a perfect gift for my kid.

The transfer from my old iPhone took a while due to the fact it first had to be updated to the latest iOS version. After the update everything else was simple.But here's the problem. The Wi-Fi icon grayed out after 2 days leaving the phone unable to connect to the internet. I did hours of research looking at 10 different fixes and tried them all three or four different times. None of them worked and most reviewers who addressed this problem said if the fixes don't work it is probably a hardware problem with probably the internal antenna and that needed to be fixed by an authorized iPhone repair shop or someone else who knows what they're doing.That wasn't going to happen so I unfortunately had to send the phone back.","helpfulVotes":5},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Make sure new phone is UNLOCKED !","date":"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2025","body":"Got this in an it was so easy to switch from iPhone7 to this iPhone 12.

This is the second refurbished phone. I purchased through Amazon. My last one I purchased was a pixel and I missed having an iPhone so I gifted that to my daughter to purchase another iPhone. Unfortunately the battery life is not the greatest. The pixel I could use for two days without charging. This iPhone, I end up having to charge after dinner time. And I don’t use it that much. Like I said you take your chances when getting a refurbished item. So I will be taking a rechargeable device with me when going on longer trips..Otherwise it’s bigger then my SE I had before, which is nice but don’t like I have to OPEN my eyes to turn off my alarm, as every External button only puts your alarm on snooze","helpfulVotes":6},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Good, except for a slightly broken volume key","date":"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2024","body":"When I received it -- straight from the package -- the volume down button was kinda janky. It works, but kind of sticks a little, and it doesn't *feel* like it works. It makes zero audible clicking noise - which I, personally, think the clicking noise is helpful because I can tell I've pressed the button - and I don't feel it click either. However everything else has been just fine. (It also would have been helpful if the box it shipped in was labelled \"Unlocked\", which was how I ordered it, and not \"AT&T\", which was how it was *actually* labelled. However I was able to figure that out.)If thr volume key didn't have issues, I would give this product 5 out of 5.","helpfulVotes":1},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Good phones","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2025","body":"Great deal for the price, the phones look very good and my kids are happy!!!"},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    More than I expected","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2025","body":"This iPhone that was bought was absolutely perfect, looked as good as a new phone, everything was perfect.

When the battery gets low, the phone is almost whispering. But now I’m starting to have issues with the screen.The screen flashes, the LED screen (green blue stripes) , I have to click the power button and restart it for that to stop. Apple won’t fix it because they said it’s an aftermarket screen they put on. Contacted the seller about the speaker and they told me to send it back, but then I would be out of a phone for a while having to ship it through the mail(as a mother, I need to have a phone on me at all times)…. I paid the extra money to get the highest quality of refurbishment…. Also When I received the phone, I had noticed a couple of dents around the back, but I didn’t mind since I put OtterBox on it. But on the back, you can see the back screen  was replaced before because it’s not closed all the way…. I’m assuming that means my phones not water resistant , But like I said, I just keep it heavy duty case on it… I had to save up for a while to get this phone, so I was kind of disappointing that it has a couple of issues. But unfortunately, with my situation, I just have to deal with it. I’m grateful that the phone can work When I need it, But I should’ve just got the basic refurbishment and not the excellent one…","helpfulVotes":4},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Love it","date":"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2025","body":"Never any issue.

Overall I adore the functionality of the phone considering it has more storage and is able to run games which my old iPhone 6s couldn’t do, though I feel like the screens on the phones this seller sells are incredibly fragile! First phone arrived with a broken screen which had the corners sticking up ever so slightly from the edges of the phone, and the white phone I bought after getting my refund (which was the first return I had ever done and took overly too long) now has a crack in the screen from falling about a foot into the floor even with a case.The thing that really bothers me about this is the fact my iPhone 6s, which I’ve had much longer than this new yet refurbished iPhone 12, doesn’t have anything broken on it externally at all even though I have similar cases on both phones! Battery health was also significantly degraded at 77%. I didn’t mind the battery health, though it doesn’t quite make the feeling of the crack in my screen any better considering I haven’t had this phone very long. My old iPhone 6s is also refurbished and bought from Walmart, though it honestly feels more durable than what this seller sells.I can’t tell if I just got unlucky twice with Amazon or if there’s something wrong with the phones sold by this seller. Either way, I don’t recommend buying a phone from here and would instead suggest buying directly from Apple. I really wanted to give this a second chance but I’m not sure it was worth the stress of having a phone screen broken twice especially when I could’ve bought something nice for my cats instead. :("},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Works great","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2025","body":"Shipped really fast and had no problem connecting to AT&T.
