      "*Based on a median mixed usage profile, actual battery life will vary. Battery must be substantially depleted; charging rate slows as charging progresses. Based on the median user tested across a mixed use profile (includes usage and standby time) under optimal network conditions. Actual battery performance will vary. Max 30W TurboPower charging speed on device; requires Motorola TurboPower 30W charger or higher (sold separately); higher chargers will not increase maximum charge capability. *Based on an internal comparison of speaker bass power between moto g - 2025 and its predecessor, moto g - 2024.",

Available RAM is less due to operating system, software and other functions; may change with software updates. *Water-repellent design creates a barrier to help protect against moderate exposure to fresh water such as spills, splashes or light rain. Not designed to be submersed in water, or exposed to pressurized water, or other liquids; may diminish over time. Not waterproof."
