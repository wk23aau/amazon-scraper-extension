{"reviews":[{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Excellent so far","date":"Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2022","body":"I ordered it on Sept 20th at $339 plus shipping of ~$34 and Morocco VAT of ~$80, so totally I paid $449.Delivery was very good. I saw it was shipped on the 25th. On the 30th, I received an SMS from DHL saying they planned delivery on Oct. 3rd, but on the same day I got an email asking for copy of national ID and content description for clearing customs. I am not a Morocco residents nor citizen, so I sent my foreign passport instead. On the 3rd, Amazon tracking info said clearing custom was delayed as additional documents were needed. So I called DHL, and the rep said it would be delivered on the 4th instead. On the 4th, I saw a newly posted message about delay on Amazon tracking. I called DHL various times but couldn't get to anyone. I then sent an inquiry by email and get a response shortly saying it was being taking care of. Then late afternoon, I got the package.Upon arriving, the seal of the packing had an opening large enough to put in a hand but not for getting the phone out, so I didn't complain.Unpacked, the inner packing of the phone was in excellent condition, very much like the original packing but had no Samsung marking, rather, it had a marking of \"amazonrenewed\". There was a film covering the screen, like on a new phone. The phone appeared in excellent condition, only had a small scratch at the back when I looked in detail, and a hair of scratch on the screen that is only visible under bright light and in a particular angle. I tried but couldn't turn on the phone - there was no response. The box also included a USB-C cable and a cheap non-Samsung charger made in China. I used my own Samsung Charger to charge the phone. After plugged in, it showed the battery was at 0. So I let it charge to full.After started, it turned out fully unlocked. My Morocco sim card works with 4G. The phone's software looked already reset, but I reset it myself anyhow. Then updated to the latest system with Android 12, and loaded many apps I need. During about the first week, the battery appeared quite poor. With medium usage it lasted about a day. I tried all necessary settings to conserve battery, but it didn't seem to help much. These couple days, it becomes much better, lasting about 45 hours. I read it was likely due to some AI processes either from Android 12 or Samsung doing the learning work at first.  But it's pretty bad the phone doesn't show any info.I would say I am very happy with the phone. And this is after having a terrible experience in the past with Samsung.The last Samsung phone I had was S7 Edge bought in Thailand (I am a traveler), new at a Samsung store for perhaps ~$800. I actually wanted the normal S7 (without the \"edge\"), but it was out of stock then. I never liked the \"edge\", it was a silly design in my mind. The phone worked well initially, but in the coming couple of years I had a terrible experience. About 5 months later when I was in Vietnam, the screen started to show shaded bands across. As I was wondering how or if I should return to Thailand to get the phone serviced, the bands disappeared after a month. Then about another 7 months later when I was in Azerbaijan, the phone couldn't start after I did a system update. So I couldn't use the phone for a couple weeks until I reached Tbilisi in Georgia  when I had someone flashed it.  About a year later, it died on me again when I was in Morocco. I had someone re-flashed it, but it was not successful.  About 1 month later I reached the city of Fes where there is a Samsung service center.  After checking, they said there was something wrong with the motherboard. Very shocking!  I've never had such problem in my life with all the phones and computers, cheap or dear, and this was a flagship!  So eventually, I sold it to a local repair shop for $200, for which they said they only needed the screen. That was end of 2017.So I never bought a Samsung again, and would definitely not buy one at the full price. I admit the S series is not worthless.  At least, I like the camera.  But I never had a chance to buy one at a largely reduced price (I won't buy from just any second-hand sellers).So now, the Amazon reviewed phone with some warranty got me interested. Yes, I have some risk, but to me with the past experience, the risk is not much higher than getting a new phone from Samsung, plus, I am putting in a much lower bet now.","helpfulVotes":118},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Good fone for the money","date":"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024","body":"Bought this fone cuz my Samsung Galaxy S20 ultra stopped sending texts and no one could figure it out. I even factory reset the fone twice Verizon went all though the setting nothing. So I was looking for fone in the $200 range and saw this. It's smaller but I dont need a mega sized screen anymore. So far had the fone around 4 months and it's been great it's light weight and fits in my hand and pocket good.  I Was able to transferred all my apps, music and contacts over with Samsung smart switch in 10 mins. The glass on here isn't very strong not like the S20 ultra witch I dropped a good amount of times no screen cracks or scratches. This S21 didn't hold up to that I was on my couch half a sleep dropped the fone under 2 feet and it sent 3 cracks across the whole screen. I didn't know it was cracked instill a few days later when the sun hit it at the right angle. I still have on the shipping screen protector not sure if that's holding it together not gonna peel it off to find out. It's been cracked for over a month now no issues with digitizer or screen tracking. It's a Octa core processor and 8 gigs of RAM it's a fast fone for all my needs even with multiple windows open in internet browser and other apps running in the background. I run my fone even on battery saver you wouldn't even know its saving energy wakes up fast no studering flips though screens fast. Fone did come like described in excellent condition. Just buy a case for it and the glass prob would have survived. Get this fone to save on your fone plan not buying there flag ship fones for high prices.","helpfulVotes":6},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":1,"title":"1.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    First and LAST time i will ever buy a refurbished device","date":"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2023","body":"I was very apprehensive about buying a refurbished phone but after reading so many 5 star reviews i pulled the trigger. The first one i got looked brand new cosmetically but any time i would go to charge it it said there was \"Water in the charging port\" and wouldn't let me charge the phone (there was no water anywhere near the phone, let alone in the charging port). That kept happening until i returned it for another one. This one (got it in March of 2023) looked great too cosmetically but functionality is the big issue. First it wouldn't give me any notifications of emails - I went through all the prompts and settings, changed everything I could...still no notifications of emails. The only time it will notify me is if I actually open up Gmail - then it will pop up saying you have x amount of unread messages but if I'm already opening the program it's completely useless! Then I started having people tell me \"I was calling you but it went straight to voicemail\" I thought it was odd but maybe it was service related. I went to my wireless provider and they said there is nothing wrong with the service it's probably the device. My wife has the same exact service with a different phone and has service throughout the house. Now not only can i not make or receive calls in my house I can't send text messages! The phone will say I have full service (5 bars) plus I'm connected to Wifi 6 with a 1 gig fiber connection. When I go to send a message it will just keep spinning and spinning until the message times out after a long time. The only way I've figured out how to trick the phone into sending messages is send the message, turn the phone on airplane mode and then switch airplane mode off again and the message will send. To add insult to injury last month I noticed a small artifact on the screen that does not go away. I've had this phone for less than a year and I have a permanent line on the screen that shows even when it's on the charging screen. I purchased this from the seller \"TheGadgetDeals\" because they had 100% positive reviews - not sure how that's possible if these are the kind of phones they are selling. So with no email notifications, no ability to make or receive calls or send text messages in my house (and a lot of times other places) I effectively have a $450 paper weight masquerading as a phone. If you're ok with spending nearly $500 on a phone that will be essentially unusable within 7 months of purchasing I say go for it, otherwise I'd look elsewhere!1/10 WOULD NOT RECOMMENDPS. After owning the phone for a month or so i purchased another one for my wife (also from TheGadgetDeals) her phone came in excellent cosmetic condition but every time she would make or receive a call the person on the other end would hear an echo of everything they said so that phone had to returned","helpfulVotes":44},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    A Premium Experience That Comes at a Premium Price","date":"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2024","body":"The Samsung Galaxy S21 5G stands proud as one of the flagship offerings of the samsung, delivering cutting-edge technology and a sleek design that is sure to turn heads. However, with a price tag that might make even the most devoted tech enthusiasts do a double-take, this smartphone raises the age-old question: is it worth the investment? Here’s my take on this splendid yet pricey marvel.Design and Display: A Visual FeastFrom the moment you lay eyes on the Galaxy S21, it’s evident that Samsung has crafted a device meant for the high-end market. The sleek contours and premium materials give it an unmistakable aura of luxury. The 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display is nothing short of breathtaking, offering vibrant colors, deep blacks, and impressive brightness levels. Whether you are streaming your favorite series or scrolling through social media, every experience is elevated by this stunning showcase of visual brilliance.Performance: Power UnleashedUnderneath the hood, the Galaxy S21 5G is powered by the latest Exynos or Snapdragon chipset (depending on your region), ensuring lightning-fast performance for multitasking and gaming alike. The device handles everything with remarkable ease, and the inclusion of 5G capabilities means you can harness incredibly fast download and upload speeds. With options for up to 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, you won't find yourself wanting for space or speed.Camera: Capture Life’s MomentsSamsung’s camera system is one of the standout features of the S21. The triple-lens setup, including a 12MP ultra-wide, a 12MP wide, and a 64MP telephoto lens, allows users to capture stunning images in various conditions. The Night Mode is particularly impressive, ensuring that low-light photos are as crisp as those taken in bright daylight. The addition of advanced video features, including 8K recording, cements the Galaxy S21’s status as a powerhouse for mobile photography enthusiasts.Battery Life: Mixed ResultsWhile the battery life is generally sufficient to get through a full day with moderate use, heavy users may find themselves reaching for a charger by late afternoon. The 4000mAh battery powers some serious capabilities, but if you plan on extensively utilizing 5G and the phone's camera, be prepared for a potential drop in endurance. Fast charging and wireless charging options are a plus, but the slightly underwhelming battery performance keeps the S21 from achieving a perfect score.Value for Money:Herein lies the crux of the matter—while the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G dazzles with features, performance, and design, it comes at a steep price. For many, this puts it out of reach, especially considering the current market of other high-quality smartphones that offer comparable features at a lower cost. The premium branding does lend a certain prestige, but that may not be enough to sway budget-conscious consumers.Final Thoughts: A Worthy Investment for SomeIn conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G is undeniably a fantastic smartphone that checks nearly all the boxes for performance, photography, and design. It’s perfect for tech enthusiasts who want the best of the best and are willing to pay for it. However, for those looking for value without compromise, exploring other options within the same price range might be a wise choice. With that said, I award the Galaxy S21 a solid 4 stars—it's good, but the expense is certainly something to consider.","helpfulVotes":3},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Very Happy with My Renewed Samsung Galaxy S21 Phone! :)","date":"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2025","body":"I am really, really happy with this renewed Samsung Galaxy S21 pnone! It arrived in such clean condition (even had protective plastic coverings on the screen and on the back of phone like new phones. If I didn't know it was renewed, I would have easily thought it was brand new. No scratches or filth anywhere that I could see (I checked with a magnifying glass). My only complaint was how long it took to arrive. It advertized as in stock yet took over a month I think to get shipped (I think it was overlooked and they were alerted by Amazon when I tried to cancel the order the day before it was expected to arrive) The seller had to ship it overnight and it arrived the next morning. So that was really good. So far the phone operates perfectly--like new! So I'm very happy, especially for the lower price I paid."},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Great Phone, Great Price","date":"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2025","body":"Phone is in excellent condition. Works properly. Arrived early. Charges fast. Looks like new."},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Fast shipping. Received in 1 day. Big performance phone for productivity (Samsung Dex)","date":"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2021","body":"So far this phone performs great. It is fast and very responsive. 16GB of RAM! I could open a lot of apps in the background and it is still running without sluggish. It is new and never been used (I think) since the imei is still good and not being registered. This phone with 512GB storage is sold out pretty much everywhere and you cannot even get them from Samsung website. Don't buy 128GB. It is useless since the storage is so small. Add $50 and you could get 256GB. However, I recommend 512GB.What is great is the camera. It works a lot better than S20 Ultra 512GB. That one was a let down and I returned it. I stuck with S8 Plus for 4 years but I love that phone. The autofocus and nightime mode improved significantly at least for me. The S20 Ultra autofocus is horrible. It seems the multitasking works a lot better to. App can easily works as popup instead of of multiple presses in s8 plus.  Speaker sounds is a bit louder and has more bass sound. Wi-Fi 6 and 5G are definitely the best features. With 5G, I am no longer having blackout in certain area around my house area. When there is no 4G LTE, 5G will take over and when there is no 5G, 4G LTE is taking over. In the past, I only have 4G LTE and 3/2G. You have three different customization on how to switch to different apps (multitasking). I haven't really go out and use the camera yet although it is the main reason why I am buying this phone. Another plus side is this is a t-mobile version.The only downside is no micro sdcard, 100X space zoom (a feature JOKE from Samsung Marketing department), 3 buttons instead of 4 and finger print from the front display. For finger print, I love the rear touch since it is more convenient to use with one hand. Finger print is a bit troublesome to detect unlike the old one. (Update: You have to press a bit harder on the display to get your fingerprint detected. So far it is working better than I first initialed test).  I am hoping Samsung will bring the sd card back in the future. Seriously 108MB, 8k (never use this feature ever), 4k size of photos and videos and you do not provide sd card? Even my Sony A7RIII works great with micro sd card in sd card adapter. There is no excuse of not giving customer sd card option. The excuse of sd card is slowing down phone performance is an old myth provided by none techies or those people who never used sd card. Not sure why the hate on sd card.  If you don't want to don't use it. Recently so many big companies either getting hacked, attacked with ramsomware or services shutting down cloud drives becoming a joke. Samsung shutting down their own cloud for photos/videos services and Google their unlimited photos. With all the security issues and possible shutdown, it is not a safe approach for storing your photos/videos for backup.To work around it, you can use- USB OTG C to female USB A/C port for USB flash drives- USB OTG sd card hub/ports with sd card readers and USB A/C ports.- 4/5 TB hdd drives are still having reasonable pricing with only small increased in pricing. I am lucky to keep up with the news to buy 8TB to 16TB drives before scalpers took over the market. S21 ultra has the ability to read exFat/fat32 by default and ntfs for small usb flash drives. For large drives like 2/4/5 TB or larger in NTFS format you need other special software to read the NTFS. NTFS format has better storage efficient and security than exFAT and fat32. I am using paragon software to read the ntfs ($9.99) and total commander.  For the usb hub station I am using, without a pd power delivery I could not read/write to ntfs hdd drives. I haven't try it on smaller OTG (USB 2.0/3.0) to see if it is working on hdd drives. Will update on that later.- Buy UHS-II readers to get faster reading/writing speed even if you are not using UHS-II sd cards.Buy one of the USB 3.1 gen 2 cable or gen 2x2 USB C to USB C to reap the 10/20 Gbps (theoretical) speed.  I will update more once in the future especially the camera part.Update:I bought a hub station with 5 USB ports (2 x 2.0, 2 x 3.0, 1 x C 3.0) 2 x hdmi, 1 x dp port, ethernet, USB c powered port (100w), UHS II regular sd and micro card reader. This thing has one usb c cable attached which you can connect to your phone. This thing is simply awesome. It is better than my old Samsung Dex which doesn't come with extra USB ports , extra display ports and sd card readers. With 100w to power this hub station, I can connect to several usb devices without the worry of connection loss issue. Since I am doing a lot of reading I don't have to use my desktops or laptops. I probably will buy a small battery powered monitor to turn this thing into a \"laptop\".Using my hub station, my wireless speed is~478.82  to ~480 Mbps  Download from Ookla. Upload is not provided but I assume it is above ~22 Mbps~380 to ~438 Mbps  Download from Google. Upload is ~23 MbpsHowever, this is my router and ISP dependable and not the phone. I should have test the phone using the 5g speed on clear and country side. Will update later on that.Next month or so I am going to use a lot of the photography so I could evaluate the camera performance. I know that from few shots, the default auto camera is a lot better than S20 Ultra (which I used only for few days). The autofocus is fast and photo taken is not blurry. The HDR processing makes the photo looks better too. I could see the clouds contour enhancement and colors look a lot better too. What I wanted to know now is the nightime shooting. I did take few snapshot in a darkroom and so far it seems to run perform better than S20 Ultra (which takes 5 to 10 seconds) or something not even getting anything during the autofocus.","helpfulVotes":24},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":3,"title":"3.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Battery life could be better","date":"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2025","body":"I've had this phone for a couple weeks. I normally buy the \"A' series when it comes to Samsung but everyone kept telling me that the \"S\" series was better. After the couple of weeks I've had this phone, I would say I like the \"A\" series better. I'm glad I did not pay full price by buying a brand new phone. The thing that I mainly do not care for this phone is the battery life. On my old Samsung I would have about 80% battery by the time I got home from work. With this phone I have about 50% battery when I get home from work. I don't use my phone a lot while I'm at work. The Phone does charge fast if you are using the proper cord but I would prefer a phone with a lasting battery, not a phone I have to constantly plug in.  With that said it makes calls, texts fine, and the app usage is ok. I normally try to keep a phone for a few years but I don't foresee that happening with this only due to the battery life."},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    One of the Best but Still Falling Short","date":"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2021","body":"I’ve spent the last number of years using a slew of different phones from OnePlus, LG, Motorola, Huawei, Sony, and the last HTC.  I haven’t used a Samsung since the S7.  I’ve avoided them because while they were well built, they had software that was so bloated, it drove me nuts.So, what is it like going to Samsung after so long?HARDWAREBack in the day, only Apple rivaled Samsung when it came to the best hardware.  Samsung can no longer make that claim.  Granted, this phone is excellent, but OnePlus, LG, and Apple are all on the same level in terms of quality build.This phone feels heavy in your hand.  I personally like that, but someone coming from an Apple might be very disappointed.  Going light weight was not a big consideration here.  It seems like they were more focused on packing as much as possible into this phone.  That leads to a big issue.Samsung has been cowed into trying to be like Apple and removed both the headphones jack and sd card slot.  I see no real reason for this beyond saving money.  Apple and Samsung claim that they can’t fit it in, or that no one uses them anymore.  Both of those are nothing but lame excuse.  Both LG and Sony put both items into their last flagships.  LG in fact released HD audio to go with the headphones jack.  After using both phones, I REALLY miss both those items.  They added a huge amount of functionality and made doing certain things so much easier.They did add the latest and greatest 5G and Wifi connectivity to this phone.  That sounds great, but I haven’t noticed it all.  I even live in an area where 5G is everywhere.  There might be more speed, but everything in my area was already fast.  It’s hard to really notice a difference unless you are running a speed test.So, this phone is S-Pen compatible.  Great.  It would be really good if it actually came with an S-Pen, but you’ll have to pay more for that.  By more I mean $40 for an s-pen designed for the Ultra, that is missing some functionality.  That’s right, you can’t do gestures.  If that’s important to you, you need to wait for the S-Pen Pro to be released “later” in 2021.  That one will have a BT connection.That really seems like a fumble on Samsung’s part.  I can understand making the s-pen optional and not having a silo for it, like on the Note, but not having the full-blown version available at launch feels like they are missing an opportunity.  If people get the regular s-pen, decide they don’t use it, what’s to motivate them into getting the pro version?The S-pen can be handy, but it only makes sense if you get a case that can hold.  Thankfully Spigen makes one that is cheap and works well.On the plus side, this phone has the fastest, most accurate fingerprint reader I’ve ever used.  It’s easily twice as fast as the one LG was using.  The ultrasonic format really makes a difference.CAMERAWhen I first used the Huawei P20 Pro, I was blown away by how good that camera was.  The things it did were unprecedented in a camera phone.  I used a number of phones after that one, and none of them ever matched what Huawei could pull off.Samsung crushed it with this camera setup.  The flexibility it offers is unmatched.  From wide angle to super zoom, it’s all there.  Some of the tricks they pull off with this camera are truly impressive.  From how it combines photos for optimal exposure to the foolish 100x superzoom, the things you can do with this camera are insane.The 100x is nothing you’ll want to use a lot.  It’s usable, but not overly clear.  Still, the mere fact that you can take a usable 100x photo with this phone is mind blowing.When I say “usable” I mean a photo that is identifiable.  It’s nothing I’m going to want to hang on a wall, but it might help trying to identify something.If there is one thing camera doesn’t do great, it’s exposure.  It tends to over expose, but that’s it.  That’s the only real issue I can find and it’s minor.You might see the 108MP sensor and think you can take some insane RAW photos with that.  To a degree, that’s true, but with a sensor like that, you’d need a HUGE amount of light to be able to get good results.  There is a reason why Samsung does pixel binning to get its incredible results.  On its own 108MP in a sensor that size is not really usable, except in ideal conditions.I love a good wide-angle camera.  LG was always a proponent of the wide-angle, and over the years, it’s really come in handy.  It’s not something you use a lot, but when you need it, nothing beats it.You get two tele-photo lenses here.  The 3X is great for framing your photos, and the 10x allows you to do things that no over phone I’ve ever used has allowed.  The 10x really comes in handy for sunsets and times when you can’t get close to your subject.CHARGINGI usually don’t do a write up on charging, but in this case, I think it’s needed.  You have wired 25W or wireless 10W.  I love that flexibility.  It’s not all good though.  You know what really stinks?  Paying through the nose for a phone, opening the box, and not getting a charger.  That’s right.  No charger in the box.  If you want one, you’ll be paying for it.  It’s hard to wrap your head around the fact that they charge you over $1,000, but couldn’t give you a charger.  I can’t remember the last time I got a phone with no charger.SCREENTill now, OnePlus had the best screen I’d seen in a phone.  It makes sense that Samsung would beat them, considering OnePlus got their screens from Samsung.  This screen is amazing.  It’s not just it’s looks either.  They did some impressive trickery here too.  The adaptive refresh is amazing.  The big issue with a 120 refresh rate is the battery it burns through.  With adaptive turned on, it adjusts.  Reading a book or something similar – it drops as low as 10.  This saves a huge amount of battery life.BATTERY LIFEIt’s good.  It’s not LG V60 good, but it’s good.  There have been times when the LG V60 lasted me for two days with normal use.  This one has the same battery, but doesn’t last that long.  It will easily make it through the day and night though.SOFTWAREWelcome to the worst part about this phone.  I know why Samsung doesn’t fix it too.  To be honest, I hate the Samsung apps, I hate the excessive bloatware, and Bixby is the worst virtual assistant I’ve ever used.The UI is the more frustrating of the issues here.  The main reason is tied to the fact that this is an Android phone.  Why do you want to be so different from stock when it’s actually hindering the experience instead of improving it?I understand what Samsung is trying to do.  They want to be Apple.  They want their own ecosystem, they control, and reap large profits off of.  That’s why they have their own assistant, apps, and UI.  I’d applaud them for that, if they grow a pair and divorce Android.  The only way all the apps, bloatware, assistant, and UI make sense if they are on their own.  Just do it already.  Become the third option, because as it stands now, your software is awful.  It’s trying to sit on a fence, which means it’s not as good as it could be on its own, and it’s NO WHERE as good as stock Android.Now, if you are a handy when it comes to Android, you can remove a lot of the junk off this phone, via ADB.  But, stop and think about that for a moment.  You just paid top dollar for a phone, and now, you have to waste a solid hour of your time stripping off all the garbage they piled on there.  How is that acceptable?If this phone was running software close to stock and didn’t have the bloatware issue, we’d be talking about a legendary phone.  One of the best phones ever made.  Instead, we have some of the best hardware ever combined in a phone, with steaming pile of dung laid on top of it.Again, if Samsung finally broke free of Android, I think things would be very different.  They might also be watching Huawei very closely to see how everything pans out for them.  Huawei was forced off Android and now runs its own OS and ecosystem.  If it goes well for Huawei, I would not be surprised to see Samsung finally pull the trigger.  They already have the OS.  It’s been in their Smart appliances for years.I know I’ve bashed Samsung a lot here, but there are some things that do that are excellent.  The first one I’ll mention is something that falls into the useful category.  It’s their side tabs.  The default is your recent apps or apps you’ve pinned.  This comes in handy since I don’t like either of Samsung’s default launcher options.  You can also add more tabs like weather and select contacts.  I first used this with the S6 Edge and I’m glad it’s still around.Now for the thing that Samsung does best, and by best, I mean no one is even close.  A deep dive into the sound settings will take you to an EQ setting.  This is not impressive on its own, since most other makers offer this.  What Samsung does that no one else does, is it gives you a hearing test and creates a custom sound profile for you.  As someone who has hearing loss, the impact this has is incredible.  The only thing I don’t understand is why it’s so buried.  I mean you need to dig to find this thing.I find it rather ironic that Samsung is more on board with Windows integration than any other maker I’ve used.  Samsung imbedded the features needed and allows you to use apps in Windows.  The others I’ve used require you to download an app and you cannot use apps in Windows.  This is a handy feature to have for anyone using an Windows PC.  They also support the cut and paste feature.  Copy on your phone – paste on your PC and vice versa.I have to relate one final frustrating issue with Samsung’s software.  The last three phones I used all were on board with Google’s autofill for apps.  That made signing into a new phone an easy experience.  Samsung has its own thing.  I spent quite a while hunting down passwords that I hadn’t used in nearly two years.WILDCARDThere is a factor to consider, if you’ve only used Apple or Samsung products.  You’ve been spoiled.  By buying the most popular phones, you’ve always had a massive selection of cases and accessories.  As someone who’s been using the fringe players for years, I’ve been stuck with only a few choices when it comes to cases.  Sometimes it was very difficult to find cases, or I had to pay more than I would have liked.Having a massive selection does add to the value, since you end up paying less for cases as everyone tries to undercut each other.  On top of that, you can find the crazy cases that include extra battery, wallets, and added functionality.  If you’re using a Sony or OnePlus, you can only dream about such a thing.This becomes even more of a value I you are one of the people in a program like Amazon Vine.  I was able to get three cases for this phone, through Vine.  Before this, only once was I able to find a case for my phone.Another factor is that there are also apps on the Play Store that are dedicated to tweaking the Samsung experience.  Some of them are quite useful.  This is something you don’t find when using the minor players.VALUEIs this phone a good value?  No.  I’m sorry at its retail price, it’s not.  The LG V60 might have a weaker camera and older processor, but it’s a far better value.  The OnePlus 9 Pro, is a slightly better value, if we are talking about a full priced phone.  If you want this phone to be a value, you need to land this phone for $900 or less.  Anything higher just isn’t worth it.  If you’re going to pay full price for this phone, you might want to look at the iPhone.  I do not like iOS, but they have an excellent build, great camera, no bloatware, and fast updates.SHOULD YOU BUY THIS PHONEIf money is not an issue and you love Samsung – yes.If money is no issue and you want the best camera – yes.If money is no issue and you want the best Android phone – maybe.If money is an issue and you want a great Android phone – buy the LG V60.If you want a clean Android experience – buy the Pixel 5 or OnePlus 9 Pro.If money isn’t an issue and you want the best phone – buy the iPhone 12 Pro Max.If you need to have a sd card and headphones jack – buy the LG V60.If you need to have a sd card and headphones jack, but hate LGs software – buy the Sony Xperia 1 II.","helpfulVotes":79},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    It's still the best phone you can get IMO","date":"Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2023","body":"This phone is kinda like a jack of all trades. Maybe when the S24 or 25 comes out, I'll get the Exynos variant, just because they spent more time developing the newest chip, it's actually made by Samsung and I heard they're easier to root. It used to be easy to root Samsung phones but now it's next to impossible and temporary if you do, before they update it.This phone is one of like 3 phones that has stylus support, a curved screen and 120hz. I wish the thing had a 1TB option or Micro SD Card support but everyone loves to copy Apple for some reason, even after making fun of them/boasting about features their phones still have. Just like with the headphone jack.I'm personally into buying or building products/devices with the least amount of brands/manufacturers, so the fact that this phone is pretty much entirely made by Samsung this year, even the Qualcomm chips, is pretty cool. I feel like GoodLock is getting more and more stuff added, for personal customization, though I wish they'd stop changing the way you can screenshot, so I don't have to keep finding workarounds. Even though there are some things they tried to take away, this phone still allows more customization than any other phone, maybe except Xiaomi. Xiaomi allows you to customize the boot logo/animation without root!eSIM WILL NOT work for Verizon or any of Verizon's MVNOs which is absolutely ridiculous. It's sucks enough that you can only store 2, only 1 can be used in junction with the regular SIM and that's fine but why does any eSIMs beyond 2 get deleted? Who knows...These speakers are loud and the Snapdragon 888 is still a great option for emulation or Android games. It doesn't get too hot and the battery can last you quite a while, even for a heavy user like Me, who downloads a million apps and keeps quite a few things in the background. It's still snappy and works as it should. The cameras are decent, probably not as good as My Pixel 5, but it's close.The charging speed, I'm used to it now but 25w? Come on... even older phones had at least 45w, but I guess Sammy was afraid more phones would go boom boom. At it's fastest rate, it will charge from around 5-10% to 100% in a little over an hour. I do love that there are so many options for accessories, since Samsung's phones are such a global phenomenon.I didn't pay much to get this phone refurbed and I just don't personally think it can be beat. The sides had a bunch of micro scratches that I just covered with a clear case, which had a Black frame, that I put on top of a skin. For the money I paid, it's nice to have a curved 120Hz 1440p LTPO screen with a ultrasonic fingerprint reader (even though it's a bit slower than it should be) and stylus support, 512GB of storage, 16GB of RAM, a Snapdragon 888, DeX/HDMI Out, a 5000mAh battery, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (even though it's super slow), a front facing camera in the middle of the screen at the top (though it'd be nice if this was under the display or just didn't exist), IP67 or 8 water resistance, extremely loud speakers, eSIM, the latest One UI + Android Security Patches until 2024 I believe, etc.I have a lot to say about this phone but overall, if you can find it for $700 or less, its a great phone and probably the last one that will be this curvy and feature packed.","helpfulVotes":7},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Next Check Scene Size","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2025","body":"Needed a phone but didn't think it was the size of my hand.

Another factor to consider is the quality of work put into \"renewing\" the device. My experience was with the seller, Synergy, and they exceeded all of my expectations. The phone looks and operates like it was brand new, and I am very happy with the purchase. When they shipped the item, they also included a support number, in case I hit a snag. (I didn't.)

I do not play games on my phone but I needed a phone that could run multiple non gaming apps smoothly as I use my phone for work and this phone does that well.However, if you are outside and the temp is above 75 80 and are using this phone, its going to start running hot very quickly and either throttling performance or not allowing you to charge the battery until it cools down even at half or less brightness. It's definitely the hottest running phone I've ever had. I've not had it overheat and actually shut down though so it's still usable. If you are gaming on it in these temps, you will probably have a much worse time so be aware of that.As for the seller, \"deals always\", they shipped my phone with firmware, while it was unlocked, would not allow it to receive any OTA updates. I've had this phone since March and was wondering why it wasn't updated past December and why I wasn't getting the OneUI 6.1 update even after manually checking and after connecting to Smart Switch. Since I am tech savvy, I flashed the firmware over to stock Samsung firmware for unlocked phones, and BAM probably did four or five updates in a row, now at OneUI 6.1 and security update at July 1. Since flashing firmware is only for advanced users, I would be weary of this seller if you ever want your phone to update.","helpfulVotes":3},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Powerful Phone","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2025","body":"This is a good phone, it has a great battery life, an awesome camera, and the processor is very fast.

The phone functioned as it should. There were some minor issues, not that they impacted function overall. There were some signs the phone was taken apart and repairs done. Upon initial start up the phone became instantly hot, like immediately. Slowly cooled down and didn't seem to get hot again. Second issue was a white substance where screen and body meet at the bottom near mouthpiece, thought it was white powder, but could not wipe away no matter what I did, even a small razor could not get rid of it. Not sure what it was, not easy to see, but it was there. Third the screen had a burn in, that was really hard to see, but when a gray background was applied there was a rectangle burn in. could not see with normal backgrounds, but it was there. Very evident, 4th issue extremely minor and again hard to see but when viewed at an angle the back showed signs of something stuck to the back. They tried to clean, but it still showed when viewed at an angle, again did not impact function. Not an issue, but it seems like some type of sticker was applied at some point. Lastly, the camera created a blue hue to all my shots. It only showed when using the camera light. Normal shots looked fine with no flash, but flashed shots always showed a blue hue no matter my settings. Overall screen looked fine and phone did function as described, no noticeable blemishes as advertised. Screen was blemish free, phone went through about 2–3 hours of updates. And installs, plus my files. So about 4–5 hrs in total get it up and running properly. But once the updates were applied, everything preformed as it should. The phone was extremely fast and transferred my number with no issues. 5g was working flawlessly and extremely fast compared to my last phone. Size is nice coming from a 6.7 in phone, but the screen on this phone was just fine. the gray color on the back is done extremely well, not cheap looking gray, but something very clean and refined. Impressed overall. Not sure if this was a company issue or Samsung issue. So not sure how to rate the company overall good experience, but examine your phone carefully. I returned mine, but you never know what you're going to get, from any of these companies, I'm sure they deal with all types of problems with phones coming in. I can just imagine. Its a crap shoot overall.","helpfulVotes":26},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Pretty Good","date":"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2024","body":"Just bought two of excellent condition, one for myself and one for my dad, and both of them seemed pretty good. I was expecting some minor scratches, but surprisingly, there wasn't any, as you can see in the photos. I ran a quick check using the diagnose in the Samsung Member app on both of them, everything seems okay including the battery, and as far as I can tell, both of them are unlocked.There are two things I do want to point out. First, I believe starting from s20, there is no more 3.5mm earphone jack, so remember to get a new earphone or an adaptor. Second, for this model particular and maybe all s21, there is no SD card slot, so you only have 128gb fixed.The one star off was for the charger that came with it. You can tell it's one of those cheap ones the moment you touch it. You can also see that the port is not aligned in the photo. What's super funny about it is that, the brick works with other cables, the cable works with other bricks, but when you put this brick and this cable together, they don't work. If you guys are buying chargers like this, I will just suggest not to include a charger so you guys can reduce some cost.With that said, this is definitely an awesome deal. After all, the price is about 1/4 of the price of the newest models, so it's worth trying.","helpfulVotes":6},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Short Battery Life","date":"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2025","body":"Battery doesn't hold the charge.

But they did not ever get back to me and tell me that they were going to take care of the problem or that they had done so.After that, other than being full of Verizon bloatware, it was fine.  I ended up only using the mother board because I dropped it about a month later. I'd dropped my old phone a bunch of times with no damage but this one was so damaged it was unusable, so I just took it to the repair place and had them remove the motherboard and pop it into my old phone. Voila!  A sturdy phone (my old one) with a working mother board (this one.)My Original Review:This phone was not 'unlocked' and is only usable on the Verizon network.  Verizon could not unlock it because it is registered to another user!  Doesn't the seller check the phones before they polish them up and resell them?  Seller initially responded to my inquiry with a request for some information off the phone which required me to go through the whole setup process.  But after I provided the info, they ghosted me.

I also love the sleek design of the phone itself, I really miss when phones looked like this. screen size is perfect.

The camera quality is outstanding, capturing sharp and vibrant photos in various lighting conditions. The display is crisp and clear, making it a joy to use for streaming videos and browsing.However, as with many renewed products, there are a few minor drawbacks. Upon receiving the phone, I noticed a few scratches on the back and sides. While these are purely cosmetic and do not affect the phone's functionality, it was a bit disappointing to see them.Additionally, the battery life isn't quite as robust as I had hoped. It generally gets me through the day, but I've noticed it drains a bit faster than expected, especially with heavy use. This isn't a deal-breaker, but it's something to be aware of if you're a power user.Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G (Renewed) is a fantastic phone that delivers high performance and flexibility. Despite a few scratches and some battery issues, I'm satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it to others looking for a great smartphone at a lower price.","helpfulVotes":11},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Takes Amazing Pics","date":"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2025","body":"It's sleek and small with an amazing camera."},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Advanced Phone!","date":"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2025","body":"Phone is in great quality and is very fast"},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Muy bonito el color","date":"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2025","body":"Exactamente lo que pedí me encantó funciona excelente"},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Good value.","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2025","body":"Good product, good price and fast shipping!

After 15 months using this phone, it's still jailed to them. Went thru many support agents, took it to T-Mobile stores, and they couldn't figure out how to unlock it. Had to pay $110 on those unlocking stores.- On-screen fingerprint sensor SUCKS, even more if you use a screen protector. The back or the side are the correct place for fingerprint sensors.- Battery is Ok-ish and can give you a full day (~10h) of battery, but you need to put almost everything to sleep, constantly close apps and have battery savings turned on 24/7. If you don't watch your usage, battery goes of in half a day (~5h) or less;- No microSD slot, I have to delete or offload stuff about twice a month;- No 3.5mm Jack, only take Bluetooth headphones;- Samsung Pay dropped it most useful Magnetic Strip feature on this phone, which was being able to do Payments on Card machines that don't take NFC, and I bought this phone looking for this feature;With that being said, if you need a good all-rounder, at current price, this is the way to go.","helpfulVotes":35},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    The best camera ever !

This cam has 108 megapixels and I can zoom the photos so close , and see details that are impossible to see with the eyes only. The video quality is great, is like a professional camera recording. It has 4k video. The only problem is that it uses a lot of processor power to record in 4k so its only good to record short videos like 20 minutes, because the phone gets hot, and stops the video and saves it if it gets hot. so I keep the video on lower quality and its still great quality. The front camera is very good too.  And the phone works pretty smoothy, doesn't usually freeze or crashes like some older phones I had.","helpfulVotes":3},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Good product description","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2025","body":"It was correctly described to what I received.

It's extremely fast, loads everything pretty much immediately, has a good, loud speaker and has done everything I have needed it to do perfectly. The only issue, and unfortunately is a very big one, is the poor battery life that it has.The SECOND I take my phone off the charger it IMMEDIATELY starts to drain even when I'm not using it or have nothing open.I'll take it off charge in the morning, look at the time and set it on my night stand on the lock screen while I get ready for work which only takes me a few minutes as I shower the night before. So simply getting out of bed, putting my clothes on and brushing my teeth is all I do and by the time I get back to my room my phone has already dropped around 5 or 6%.I work 8 hours. By the time I get to work my phone is usually in the 80s percentage wise and at the end of my work day it's fully dead.All of my older phones: Samsung Galaxy A50, LG V20, etc all had very long lasting batteries even though they were much cheaper phones than this and they would literally last me from the minute I woke up, until the minute I went to bed and that's WITH continuous usage including playing Spotify all day at work.This phone dies so quickly and if I'm using it continuously or using it to listen to Spotify at work it will die within a matter of two hours and that may be generous.I'm not sure why the battery is so bad, I know it's likely because it's refurbished because I'm sure a brand new model wouldn't be like this, but with this refurbished phone the battery life is horrendous.Other than that though this is a wonderful phone and if you get one that has a good battery I am 100% guaranteed that you will be MORE than satisfied!","helpfulVotes":12},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Great deal on refurbished phone, only a few problems that were resolved","date":"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2024","body":"The first phone I received looked like NEW and worked well I thought until I received a call.

I have the Ultra 23 and like it a lot and this has many of the same features for about a 1/3 of the price of a new Ultra 23.  The Ultra 21 looked brand new when it arrived and my brother-in-law loved it. It has worked great until the end of the 11th month.  The first problem was that it stopped being able to make calls or receive calls.  We talked to Verizon customer service and they had us remove the SIM card and then re-activated it via an ESIM download.  The very next day the phone stopped charging via a C-cable.  We tried different cables and made sure the C-port had not debris in it. Nothing helped. Fortunately, the phone would still accept a charge wirelessly.  Unfortunately, it stopped making calls the day after that unless on wi-fi.  - The phone has been protected in a case and shows no sign of physical damage so there appears to be no reason for these problems other than defective components.

The phone was delivered on time and packaged very securely and with protective stickers. Came with a Samsung charger that looks new. The phone is in EXCELLENT condition, literally looks brand new. There is a hairline little scratch on the screen you can barely see which I'm going to cover with a screen protector anyways. Phone was at 82% when it arrived.

More like \"excellent\" than \"like new\" condition though.","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2022","body":"After spending a day with my \"new used\" S21, I am very happy with it. I live in the Southeast and use C Spire, a smaller carrier, so I was a little apprehensive about this phone's true \"unlocked\" status, but I popped the SIM in, and the device was immediately up and running. No worries there. Between that and the native software to transfer contacts, texts, etc, the transition beteen my old Galaxy and this one was quick and seemless. The phone itself is gorgeous. The deep colors, that awesome refresh rate, video, scrolling, all good stuff and why I'm a Galaxy S dude. I can tell with just a little experimenting that the camera is pretty good too, though I'm not much of a photographer. Having said that, the few unskilled snapshots I've taken look pretty danged nice. The battery life, eh. Not quite as good as my old S9+, at least in the first couple of years of that phone's life, but not as horrible as some reviews make it out to be. After a fair amount of YouTube, browsing, and adding apps, lasting the day wasn't a problem. I think most will be good with it. My only complaint: Amazon says these refurbs are sold in like new condition. And this is the third S I've bought renewed from Amazon, and have had *zero* problems until this little bugaboo. This is one great phone, and overall looks pretty new, but there is what appears to be a little chip in the bezel on the left side. It isn't hugely noticeable, but it certainly is there, and is discolored compared to the metal around it.  I would really describe the phone as more in excellent condition than like new, but by no means would I call this a deal-breaker, but  it does make me feel like I spent a little more on the phone than I should have. But, you know, the horror stories I've seen in other reviews have not been my experience on go-round number three, so all in all it's not the worst thing ever.","helpfulVotes":11},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":3,"title":"3.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Not \"Refurbished Excellent\"","date":"Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024","body":"The product was delivered at the time promised...

The bottom right of the screen had dead pixels that wouldn't light up no matter how I tried to troubleshoot. I had to request a refund and then order again (couldn't get a replacement for an already replaced one).The third one came, and everything seemed perfect. I had already started getting the phone set up when I realized that the bottom speaker was not working at all no matter what I tried. So I returned again and was about to give up and try to find a new one to purchase.I decided to give it one more go, and my FOURTH one came earlier this week.

Every one of my friends and family said my voice was very clear and loud! Also, I don't have a hard time hearing people from the other side of the call.  It runs very fast and it doesn't glitch on any of the apps I downloaded on it. Also I use my phone a lot and I can go for a whole day without charging my phone.I do have a problem with the brick and charger cord that came with it. The charger cord was rusted on the one end of it and my Samsung didn't support the cord. The brick is a huge fire risk! I was charging my phone with a different cord and I started to smell this burning electrical smell. I realize it was coming from the brick and when I unplug it, it was very hot.

Oled screen, 120 hz, bigger screen size, hole punch camera, only got it for $240 or so. The issue I have with this phone is I noticed the volume button doesn't work as well and likes to get stuck which is annoying.

I have to stick to my iPhone because I can't use cellular data unless I get a esim card but I don't want to do that. I am honestly going to return this phone because it's pretty much a android iPod that I can only use at home. I recommend just buying a new samsung galaxy s23 and get on a payment plan or save up and buy the phone in full. The other scenario is if you happen to fall in this situation you could return the phone and get another one and bank on the fact it doesn't have the same issue or a new issue with it.

Regardless, I manually clicked on updates and found out that there was indeed an update. After 3 hours to download and install, my phone now makes calls and works perfectly.So, here are things you may want to try if your phone won't make calls:  1. Check your phone on AT&T's website (not just your provider). Check to see if your phone should still work on AT&T's 5g.

Luckily my watch unlocks the phone just fine. I've had no problems with the very minimally curved screen, and love listening to music in stereo thanks to the ear piece working with the main speaker.As for the seller, the phone arrived in its original box and wrapped completely in its six sided protection plastic.My next phone may only be the Plus instead of the Ultra, but I didn't mind paying a Plus price for this Ultra.","helpfulVotes":5},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Worth The Price And Like New","date":"Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2022","body":"had i not been told that this product was refurbished, i would not have known. the product is completely cleaned of any grease/dirt/scratches and came with a charger and a little manual.i do not know how long the battery life is compared to a new phone because this is my first android (i had a 1TB iphone pro max 13 but felt it was high-time to switch to an open source linux-based OS even if it meant a cheaper yesteryear phone). i'm really hoping that the korean refurbishers swapped in a new battery just because that is the first thing that ages in smartphones. if i like the customizability on tjis older phone then i'll definitely upgrade to a fancier new samsung in a year or two.my only complaint so far is that the phone came with a completely empty battery. i know that electricity is expensive when you are shipping out old discount phones but i'm going to have to wait all night for a full charge. new iphones tend to come at 60% or so and i was a little worried that the android wasn't turning on until plugged in. it's currently at 8% but not charged up enough for me to open it yet.on a side note, i really appreciate that this product came from a clean capitalist country like korea. i am morally opposed to buying from china and india out of ecological and geopolitical concerns, and amazon heavily favors chinese exports in general.","helpfulVotes":21},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Great Phone - Poor Battery!","date":"Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2023","body":"This phone arrived (was picked up, rather) in excellent condition - visibly. It is clean, light weight, fast, functions well.  It flows apps like Netflix and security cameras very well with fantastic clarity.  Overall, it is a really nice phone.The drawbacks: - the battery life is miserable, requiring charging at least twice a day or more, and I rarely have Mobile Data  or other power draw apps running - the Hotspot icon is missing from the dropdown menu, and I found no means of adding it - the Messages apps has the annoying \"<Subject: No Subject>\" error, and I have found no way to clear it. I have owned Samsung S3, S6, and S8, and never experienced this error beforeMy biggest problem is the vendor shipped the phone via FedEx who, for some reason, has NEVER DELIVERED A PACKAGE TO MY HOME CORRECTLY!  I had to go the them to pick it up after two failed delivery attempts; however, I can't hold that against the vendor.  Other than that, great phone!","helpfulVotes":3},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    A great phone for great price","date":"Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2024","body":"I always wanted a flagship phone but couldn't afford the new ones but this one is just right for my budget. I love the camera quality, it can record 4k 60fps which is incredible. The sound and display are pretty good and overall its fast. However, it came with a few minor scratches on the edges and paint peeled off at the charging port. but if you are going to use a phone cover, that shouldn't be a problem. The battery is not that great especially if you are a heavy user. But a light user like me can go almost a whole day on a full charge.

Also, important to note that Verizon doesn't have RCS texting, so if the alarm SIM card was from Verizon, you won't be able to use that feature. luckily I had one from a carrier that supported it, so was able to pop it in and unlock that feature. The screen did have some light scratches on it, but barely noticeable during use.Next thing is to make sure you complete system updates, create or login in to your Samsung Account and get app updates. Phone works great and no major issues other than above. Phone works as described and came with accessories, though I didn't test the cable and brick (third party) as I already had one. Overall good experience. Would buy again, however, id make sure it was Factory Unlocked next time to avoid the Sim issues.","helpfulVotes":2},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Very very good phone, except came with cheap SLOW charger","date":"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","body":"Very very good condition for a used phone, except came with (brand new) cheap SLOW charger.  As expected per many reviews,this Samsung model phone is indeed rather heavy leading to hand-cramps for long calls / long use periods, but that's not Seller's fault.  Based on a few comparisons I saw on-line, the phone that arrived was NOT a counterfeit, which is good -- it was my biggest worry.  There are counterfeits out there are VERY hard to discern from the real bonafide Samsungs (so do homework before buying) and beware of sketchy sellers too.

I chose the color white, and it's flawless...except for the screen, which I discovered a few days into using it.  I'm not sure what the reason could be, but my fingerprints on the screen look as if I had grease on my hands, and very smudgy!  I had the Samsung S9 for five years prior to this phone, and I kept the screen clean with alcohol wipes, but when I try it with this phone, it just smears more, never gets clean/clear, and the screen just seems like a different kind of glass than what is normally on phones.  Also, I can see a two inch long horizontal line of what looks like a streak of water under the screen about an inch from the top, and it's visible all the time, so for that reason, and the issue with the screen, I'm not sure yet if I will keep this phone.  I believe I have 90 days, or at least I hope that is the case.  Other than that, it works well and no issues so far.","helpfulVotes":7},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Pretty sweet deal for such an amazing phone!","date":"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","body":"I was hesitating if buying a renewed phone would be a good idea since I've had mixed results in the past buying refurbished/renewed products on Amazon. However, this particular purchase went incredibly well! And I'm beyond happy and satisfied with my decision to not buy brand-new. The Samsung Galaxy S21 is seriously underrated compared to newer models. This phone's got it all! Superb cameras, a gorgeous 120Hz display and a super fast processor (even for today's standards). I can't really comment on the battery life since I just got my phone today, and it came with only 1% charge left.The phone seems to heat up quite a bit while downloading, updating and installing apps, which is to be expected. However, there are plenty configuration options to help tackle this and more issues. For instance, you can adjust the CPU Processing Speed, helping cope with larger processing loads or help extend battery life.There are certain, minimal comestic dents here and there throughout the phone's body and screen, but, as adevertised, they aren't really visible at a glance.I would definitely recommend buying this phone from this seller if you're looking for a renewed top-notch phone!","helpfulVotes":1},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Easy once you figure it out","date":"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2022","body":"Edit: I had never had issues with an unlocked phone until now so it took some figuring out. I ended up leaving Xfinity and after 5 days of on/off customer service where they goofed up constantly trying to activate this phone. Verizon was no help either. I ended up going with Tello because in the settings it shows this phone was Sprint brand and Tello is part of Sprint/uses their networks, anyway just 5 minutes with their chat agent and I was good to go. The seller was also easy to talk to, fast at responding and offered to send a replacement or refund if I returned the phone. I wouldn’t hesitate buying from them again! Apparently, s21 in general has trouble with different carriers so triple check.---------------After several days and nights on the phone or in the chats with various carriers trying to activate this phone, I had a gut feeling and went to Sprint to ask them if the IMEI is locked. Lo and behold, it is a locked phone not unlocked and they need the account owner's details to unlock it. So now I have a useless locked phone for about $500 + the phone case + the screen shield + the money wasted on sim cards from different carriers + the time and sleepless nights trying to troubleshoot this + my old phone is now deactivated and having trouble reactivating after the carrier tried so many workarounds for this phone. It's a nightmare and a half. I've never had trouble with a renewed phone before and I even paid extra for the certified like new version. I contacted the seller to see what can be done. I'd rather be able to unlock this one but I don't think that's an option and I'll have to waste time back and forth.

So, great experience on the fast delivery.  The phone is in very good shape, no noticeable scratches on the back or screen.  When I turned on the S21 the very first time, the system automatically asked me if I wanted to transfer data from another Galaxy phone, so the process of transferring data from my old S10 to this new S21 was very easy.  I haven't actually used the phone yet, but just wanted to say the phone arrived in great condition, and everything seems to be working.

The Samsung s21 however does not get as good of a rating. First of all it has a weird cell service issue where I get poor and inconsistent reception, after looking into online I found out this has been a known issue for a while with people complaining about it on different websites. Very annoying! Also it gives you notifications from the Samsung galaxy store for weird games and apps AND YOU CANNOT TURN OFF THE NOTIFICATIONS FROM IT. While its only a minor annoyance it is the principle of the matter that bothers me. The phone runs smoothly and its a pretty good overall but between the cell service and the ridiculous Samsung ad notifications I choose to switch to a Oneplus phone.","helpfulVotes":3},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":4,"title":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Not Bad for a Renewed Phone","date":"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2024","body":"I love the features and zippiness of the phone.

The back, however, seems to have been glued on with a not-so-good adhesive,  but I can't tell if that's from the renewal or Samsung. Still, not bad at all, and the battery life is great. All in all, it's a good buy. Just remember that it's CARRIER unlocked, not BOOTLOADER unlocked.

After completing the transfer, my new phone has performed perfectly. I closely inspected it and didn't find any imperfections at all.However, I did notice the back cover of my new phone has been replaced with a plastic aftermarket type cover that doesn't have the Samsung name on it. But, that was not a deal breaker for me because it keep it in a protective case anyways and the function of the phone was more important to me.Included in the shipping box with my new phone was a new charging cord, charging cube, Sim card slot key and also seller contact information with warranty and return information also.Overall I am very happy with my new purchase experience and my new phone.I highly recommend this seller in buying a refurbished phone in hopes of settling any doubts you may have as I did initially.I will be purchasing another phone for my son next week from this seller after having such a good experience!","helpfulVotes":11},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I haven't been disappointed","date":"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2025","body":"I'm heading into my third year with this phone and I have no complaints, none."},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    My brother loves this phone","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2025","body":"Best buy.

Simply plugged in the sim card, ask to transfer data, put the phones on top of each other, and the phones took care of the rest. Very simple.Value: I hate spending money on technology. I cannot justify spending $1000+ on a device I can quickly runover. (Why I'm replacing my current s8+). For a phone that will still receive a couple more years of updates, has technology that is still very usable, and looks impressive, I cannot be happier. This is a refurbished phone, so I can't expect a perfect phone. It's the luck of the draw.

Love the Samsung bundled apps like Samsung TV plus which has 200+ free channels to watch. Also the Samsung Notes app which lets you annotate PDFs and take notes. The sound quality and screen is premium quality. The camera takes high quality photos. App-switching using the Octa-core SnapDragon 888 processor is lightning fast.However, if you are buying this phone renewed and use a piggyback carrier in the US such as Tello, etc then please check for network compatibility. I found the cellular network on this device for Tello was not stable and kept dropping every minute (the bars kept disappearing and reappearing). The outgoing and incoming calls also did not go though. Even tried converting physical SIM to eSIM and still problem of making calls. The device went through several system updates to be able to jump on the 5Ghz WiFi network, which initially was not enabled. 2.4Ghz WiFi worked out of the box without applying updates.Overall, a great phone and happy with it. Once the cellular network compatibility issue is resolved, will plan to keep it after an exchange of this defective device with another one.","helpfulVotes":25}],"reviewCount":0,"reviewAvgRating":null,"status":"completed"}
