The phone is in excellent condition as described. The screen has one needle pin scratch (literally a teeny tiny dot that is less than a speck of dust) and one scratch that‚Äôs less than a mm, which is incredible. I expect some wear and tear, but it is way better than my expectations and experience buying refurbished phones. I‚Äôm very pleased. It‚Äôs as described if not better. I will be purchasing from this seller again. Great prices and reviews on their page by the way. Works like brand new and it has 86% battery life. Came with a charger box and a chord, very nice of them to include both with the amazing deal it was already at. I would recommend anyone to buy a phone from here and am eyeing another now for family.

Battery health was a bit low at 90% but was in great condition and works well. I had a it of trouble setting up the Apple ID, I upgraded from an IPhone 12. I had previously disconnected my previous line so no longer have the number. Unfortunately the old number was still connected, so every time I would try to use the Apple ID connected to the iPhone 12 it would send a confirmation code to the phone number so I had no way of using the phone number. So I had to create a new Apple ID and email. Other than that everything works fine and I purchased the yellow option and love the phone and the color is cute!üíõüíõüíõ","helpfulVotes":10},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":1,"title":"1.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    1st purchase was great! This one was not!","date":"Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2024","body":"I have had this iPhone for 38 days.It has the worst battery life of any iPhone I've ever owned, and I have owned ONLY iPhones since the first version was released 17 years ago.This is the second iPhone 14 that I've bought from the renewed store .The first one I bought on December 4th, 2023, and I could not have been happier with the phone.It arrived in brand new condition, and performed flawlessly.On the recommendation of a friend, I checked the battery health and charging after having it for MONTHS and it was at 100%! I was thrilled!I absolutely loved the phone!I never had a single problem with it.Unfortunately, on July 30 of this year I dropped it, and it was beyond repair.I immediately went back to the Amazon renewed store and purchased another iPhone 14 because my experience with the first one was so fantastic.It arrived in new looking condition, exactly like the one I bought in December 2023.It was not scratched or anything really noticeable, it just seemed to be \"worn\" a little bit, but I fully understood that it was a renewed phone, and any cosmetic issues were not that important to me, including the color, which, when my iPhone is in its case, you cannot tell what color it is anyway.Unfortunately, I DID NOT look at the battery health and charging when I first got the phone 38 days ago, but I did look at it about two weeks ago, and it said 93%.I thought, ok, it's a renewed phone, it's not going to have 100% battery life.I can live with that.Well, I just looked at it today and it's now at 90% battery health and charging.So this phone is dying quickly.After being fully charged it dies within hours.I have it completely set up for optimized battery life.I have lost emails and messages that I was in the middle of composing, and the phone just dies.I've been in the middle of important phone calls when the phone dies, simply because I had just fully charged it a few hours before that, and thought I would be fine for hours to come.I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery a week ago, and I was on the phone with my doctors office yesterday about my first post-op appointment, and my phone died in the middle of it.I thought I had HOURS left before the phone would die.Then I had to plug it in, and wait for it to come back alive, so I could call my doctor back and hopefully not wait a half hour after losing my place in line.On top of that is also has issues with the touchscreen being glitchy, and sometimes I have to tap on things several times to get them to work.As I said, I have been an iPhone owner/user since the very first version came out 17 years ago.I've always loved all my iPhones, and I will continue to be an iPhone user for the rest of my life.This is in no way reflection on Apple iPhones whatsoever.They are an amazing and fantastic piece of technology.I think I just got a bad one for the first time in my life.Luckily, I have just checked and I have until November 6th to return this phone, and I WILL be returning it.The problem is, what do I do in the meantime?Am I expected to buy a new one and get that shipped to me, transfer all my information from this phone to the new one, and then return this one?That is extremely hard to do financially!I am actually still paying for this phone on my Amazon Prime American Express card!Or, do I return this phone and wait until the refund has been issued and then buy another phone? Then wait until that is sent to me.I would not have a phone for at least a week in the interim, and we all know these days that's a practical impossibility.I am also having several medical issues.Like I said, I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery last Monday, September 9th, and have several upcoming follow up appointments, and physical therapy appointments.I also have several other non-related medical issues that definitely require that I have a phone.I just don't know what to do.","helpfulVotes":165},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Well, worth the purchase","date":"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2025","body":"Awesome product I chose the excellent unlocked version.

When we cut on the phone we set it up to transfer the old phone material first, then it wanted to upgrade the software prior to the transfer.  The upgrade spooled around for 18 hrs, then the portability function (over WiFi and Cloud) simply would not work.  AT&T couldnt figure it out....we sent the phone back thinking it was defective (turns out it was fine), got a new phone same model, etc.New phone had the same issues, and I was thinking at this point it cannot be coincidence so it must me a software conflict.  And....it was.  After MUCH tinkering with it here is the workaround for those of you who are in the same situation (as an aside, we were upgrading my wife's ancient XE to a 14 but I think this happens with a lot of phones no matter the model)1.  Cut on the new phone2.  Opt to NOT set up the new phone with the old phone (ie, do NOT transfer the old phone data yet).3.  Go to settings, opt to update the software to 18.0.14.  After this, ERASE the phone.  It will keep 18.0.1 on there, it will remove any impediments to port over the information.5.  KEEP the e-sim information on there(it gives you that option when you erase, it is ok not to do it but you will have to put it back on so just keep it on).6.  Boot the phone back up7.  OPT to set it up with the old phone (likely the older phone will prompt you for this first).8.  You can set it up over Wifi or Cloud, make sure you have backed up the old phone on the cloud just before set up if you opt for that.9.  There is an option to use direct cabling to transfer, but it is a pain because Apple insists on using the proprietary cabling they have, so it means you have to first port everything onto a laptop then transfer it.  Safer but not any quicker.  I would not do that unless you have cloud issues and/or bad WiFi.Phone has worked great since we did the workaround, and I want to compliment the seller as they were quick to send a replacement phone to us and very communicative on the issues.  I hope the workaround here helps others, it was utterly baffling to us.  Apple needs to get it together on the portability issues since they just released the new model and apparently this is an issue with a number of older to newer transfers, very disappointing for them to not catch this.","helpfulVotes":29},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Used iPhone 14 Excellent","date":"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2025","body":"iPhone showed up in like new condition.

What it does not mean is a new battery. Mine had a battery with 84% charge capacity. In fairness, the company‚Äôs fine print indicates this so that‚Äôs on me to have overlooked that. In fairness I did get a ‚Äúnewer‚Äù phone just not one that was ‚Äúlike new‚Äù which meant like a new one, not just close.

While I appreciate the quick turn around on my order and delivery, the device had issues.For starters, the refurbished one I ordered and received took a long time to set up. You couldn‚Äôt just pair it with another device to get everything transferred. If you tried this, you would see the latest update would take days to complete and the timeline never changed.I reached out to apple and they helped me get it set up, however, there were several performance issues with the device I received.Total time it took to get the phone set up: 6.5 hours.Details: Started at 4pm as soon as the device was delivered, and after seeing the update was still not completed around 9pm, I worked with Apple support to get the device finally set up around 10pm.Performance issues:The charging port was loose, so even if the device was connected to a plug in charger, it wouldn‚Äôt always charge. This also impacted connection to CarPlay when driving. The phone would be sitting in the seat beside me, plugged in, but if it moved slightly, the connection wouldn‚Äôt work and I‚Äôd have to unplug it and plug it back in. It‚Äôs not tight enough to keep a good connection.There was an issue with screen responsiveness and phantom typing. If you needed to tap or select anything closer to the edge of the screen, it wouldn‚Äôt register. At times the screen wouldn‚Äôt respond at all, or if it was face down and I picked it up, I would see it was randomly typing characters in the Home Screen search box. I would have to manually turn the screen off (side button) for it to stop.There was also an issue with the front facing camera and sensor. The camera was really fuzzy and not able to pick up anything at times. The sensor wouldn‚Äôt always correctly adjust the screen brightness over the night I had it.The physical device itself also has scratches and dents all over it. While I don‚Äôt care about cosmetic as much as the above, the phone I received was more along the lines of poor condition overall.For this seller, I think it would be a good idea to do more intensive performance testing with the phones/devices before you send them out. You should also include correct setup instructions with the devices so your customers can set them running with ease and not have to waste half a day trying to get the phone setup to work.Overall, with the issues and hassle I experienced with the device I was sent, it was more cost effective to go buy the same model in new condition for the additional $100 at a local Best Buy.","helpfulVotes":2},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    It works great","date":"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2025","body":"Looks great and works great."},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Like new","date":"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2025","body":"Perfect"},{"reviewerName":null,"rating":5,"title":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    tel√©fono como nuevo","date":"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2025","body":"Excelente calidad precio.
