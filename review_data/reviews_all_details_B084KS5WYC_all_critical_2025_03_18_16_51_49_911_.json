      "body": "Kudos to TheGadgetDeals.  The phone appears to be excellent.  It was unlocked as advertised and easily setup with a Mint mobile sim card.  It is smaller than most new phones, which is why I wanted it, and it has a very easy user interface compared to a Motorola phone.  I would buy this again.  If any unpleasant surprises come up i will update this review.  It is older tech, but it works fine for me and the price was great at $72.",

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2023",
      "body": "The Phone was in a factory package but upon opening it would not charge after many attempts it finally began to charge.  So I began setting up the phone . Initially I was on WiFi so setup proceeded as expected,  then I switched off WiFi and discovered that the phone was locked from att Sim use. I noticed that the phone was a tracphone so I contacted tfunlock and after 24 Hrs was able to unlock. But the phone would not work on data plan so I researched how to setup the APN settings to look like my other phone but they were greyed out.  There were four options before a factory reset and on the forth I was able to force APN settings that worked with att but it was still using the VMNO setting that are forced on tracfone which delivers way weaker signal than my other phones about 20 dbm's which is significant signal loss.  So  thought ID contact the manufacturer.  I connected the charger and attempted to continue setting up the next day but the phone has not recharged since and I have tried two different chargers and 3 different cords all of which work on my other phones.",

      "body": "This is my third Galaxy A10e, the other two were bought new from Tracfone a few years ago and are still working fine. I needed an extra one for a trip, so I could use another SIM card for roaming. All is well with the phone, except that the screen is dimmer than my older original one. The screen on this renewed one looks dimmer and off-white in color, when the brightness it at the same level as my other phone. I normally have my brightness down low around 10% on the scroll bar, but have to turn brightness up to around 50% on the scroll bar in order to get it even close to the brightness on the original, but that will use more battery power to run it with the brightness up so high, and it's still not as bright as the old one. I sent a message to the seller about this issue.When I took the phone out of the box, before turning it on, I noticed that it looks brand new, the screen and the entire phone. Amazing in that respect. It had a 68% charge, so I charged it up to 100%, then set up the phone and it's already down to 68% again.",

Usually I have to use the power button a few times to get the screen to light up properly and then it works. Not ideal but manageable. The phone also will randomly disconnect from the service network and I have restart the phone to make a call. Also nothing major it doesn't happen all the time. Overall for what I spent and having the protection on it I can make it work until I can buy a newer phone on my phone plan. It was definitely the cheapest option and I appreciate that even with a few issues. Otherwise the phone was well maintained and in great physical condition. No cracks or dings and it does what I need it to.",

      "body": "I have owned 3 of these cell phones now.  Bought the first in October 2019.  Lasted about one year, then the screen went black.  It was not dropped or abused.  Most of the time it was tethered  to my computer for internet service, so I could run my Amazon seller business.  When the screen went black it was a disaster.  With Amazon's two-step verification, I could not access my Amazon account to buy a replacement cell phone, confirm my Marketplace sales, or ever turn off my store.  Tried Walmart for a replacement, but they had nothing that would work with my 4G T-Mobile account.  I had no choice but to drive over 100 miles to a uBreakiFix same day repair shop.  The screen was replaced for about $100.  More than a year later, same thing happened again.  Paid another $100.  6 months later, same thing, $100.  Next time the it happened within the 3 month  uBreakiFix warranty (now owned by Asurion), so they fixed it for free.  So I decided it would be cheaper to buy a back-up Samsung Galaxy A10e.  I purchased an unlocked one here and made sure I got the 2 year Asurion warranty.  That phone was DOA.  Returned it and received refunds for both the phone and the warranty.  Bought another.  Less the a month later the screen just went black again, but I was still connected to Amazon, so I quickly purchased a Google Pixel 3 64GB Unlocked GSM & CDMA 4G LTE, with an Asurion warranty.  Then I returned the third phone for both refunds.  I hope the Pixel 3 works better.",

I love Samsung phones so I was happy to come across this one. It was pre-used but there aren't any scratches or anything major with it. They also included a charging cable because it takes a Type C as well as a USB adapter wall plug. They also put in a paper that tells you about the unlocked phone and how to get it to use other carriers chip (I forget what they are called). The only thing I wasn't really happy was that I am pretty sure that it advertised the phone as black and so I bought a black and clear case to go with it however when I got the phone it was actually blue.

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2021",
      "body": "The phone is probably a decent budget phone when it's new. I bought this as a replacement for a much better but also much older phone for a teenager.2 stars because, even for a budget phone, it felt super cheap. Now, I suspect this was most likely due to it being a renewed product. Most often I think refurb phones are OK. In this case though I think whoever fixed up this phone used cheap replacements and did a bad job of it because oem parts would cost almost as much as the phone!. From day one  the phone was nearly unusable due to constant phantom touches all over the screen that would hang up calls, switch between or close apps, and cause the screen to get stuck alternating between the two home screens, like someone frantically swiping left and right on the home screen. Anyway, as I mentioned the phone screen also felt super cheap and it even started to separate along the top edge. Within a couple days the screen also started to crack and what little glue was holding on the screen must have given up because the whole screen (glass, digitizer and lcd) just fell right off. I'm sure this was the exception to the rule but just be aware you stand a better chance of getting a lemon on a refurb/renewed phone.  Better to buy refurb flagship phones. You can get a decent new budget phone for slightly more than this renewed budget phone.Moto G anyone?",

Trust me, this isnt someone that would expect a new S21 Ultra for $100, they are very reasonable and didnt expect to be blown out of the water, so the depth of their disappointment was very telling. Luckily there was some sort of trade in promo that their local ATT was running and so they ended up trading this in the next day without even wasting time trying to live with it and got a new phone for a couple bucks.",

It is a little smaller than my wife's A20 but that doesn't bother me as it fits in my pocket better. The only complaint is that without a case this phone is very slippery. Also, I would like a longer charging cord. I would definitely recommend buying an aftermarket case along with the phone. Nice phone at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend.",

Initially I was on WiFi so setup proceeded as expected,  then I switched off WiFi and discovered that the phone was locked from att Sim use. I noticed that the phone was a tracphone so I contacted tfunlock and after 24 Hrs was able to unlock. But the phone would not work on data plan so I researched how to setup the APN settings to look like my other phone but they were greyed out.  There were four options before a factory reset and on the forth I was able to force APN settings that worked with att but it was still using the VMNO setting that are forced on tracfone which delivers way weaker signal than my other phones about 20 dbm's which is significant signal loss.  So  thought ID contact the manufacturer.  I connected the charger and attempted to continue setting up the next day but the phone has not recharged since and I have tried two different chargers and 3 different cords all of which work on my other phones.",

Most of the time it was tethered  to my computer for internet service, so I could run my Amazon seller business.  When the screen went black it was a disaster.  With Amazon's two-step verification, I could not access my Amazon account to buy a replacement cell phone, confirm my Marketplace sales, or ever turn off my store.  Tried Walmart for a replacement, but they had nothing that would work with my 4G T-Mobile account.  I had no choice but to drive over 100 miles to a uBreakiFix same day repair shop.  The screen was replaced for about $100.  More than a year later, same thing happened again.  Paid another $100.  6 months later, same thing, $100.  Next time the it happened within the 3 month  uBreakiFix warranty (now owned by Asurion), so they fixed it for free.  So I decided it would be cheaper to buy a back-up Samsung Galaxy A10e.  I purchased an unlocked one here and made sure I got the 2 year Asurion warranty.  That phone was DOA.  Returned it and received refunds for both the phone and the warranty.  Bought another.  Less the a month later the screen just went black again, but I was still connected to Amazon, so I quickly purchased a Google Pixel 3 64GB Unlocked GSM & CDMA 4G LTE, with an Asurion warranty.  Then I returned the third phone for both refunds.  I hope the Pixel 3 works better.",

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2021",
      "body": "The phone is probably a decent budget phone when it's new. I bought this as a replacement for a much better but also much older phone for a teenager.2 stars because, even for a budget phone, it felt super cheap. Now, I suspect this was most likely due to it being a renewed product. Most often I think refurb phones are OK. In this case though I think whoever fixed up this phone used cheap replacements and did a bad job of it because oem parts would cost almost as much as the phone!. From day one  the phone was nearly unusable due to constant phantom touches all over the screen that would hang up calls, switch between or close apps, and cause the screen to get stuck alternating between the two home screens, like someone frantically swiping left and right on the home screen. Anyway, as I mentioned the phone screen also felt super cheap and it even started to separate along the top edge. Within a couple days the screen also started to crack and what little glue was holding on the screen must have given up because the whole screen (glass, digitizer and lcd) just fell right off. I'm sure this was the exception to the rule but just be aware you stand a better chance of getting a lemon on a refurb/renewed phone.  Better to buy refurb flagship phones. You can get a decent new budget phone for slightly more than this renewed budget phone.Moto G anyone?",

      "body": "I cant really give a review of the actual phone since i didnt see this purchase in person myself, but I can comment on the condition since it was renewed. The person i bought this for said that the phone was in poor condition and didnt come with the charger as was specified as included at the time of purchase. Trust me, this isnt someone that would expect a new S21 Ultra for $100, they are very reasonable and didnt expect to be blown out of the water, so the depth of their disappointment was very telling. Luckily there was some sort of trade in promo that their local ATT was running and so they ended up trading this in the next day without even wasting time trying to live with it and got a new phone for a couple bucks.",
