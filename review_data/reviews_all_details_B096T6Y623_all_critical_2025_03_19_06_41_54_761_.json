      "body": "Starting out, I was super skeptical about getting a used phone online. But, i have to say it met my expectations and I love the phone. The phone itself is amazing. The camera quality is unparalleled by any other that I've seen. And the customizable features are awesome. You can make it YOUR phone. Pairs with other electronics exceptionally well. Processor speed is top notch, everything loads really fast. Downloads take no time. Set up was very easy. All in all, Galaxy S21 Ultra was an incredible investment on my part. Love it."

      "body": "The description says that is a refurbished excellent condition phone, the screen is perfect probably have been reemplased, the phone works good but the condition of the frame and the cameras has a lot of dents and I feel like I been scammed, I will not return the phone just because I bought it has a secondary work phone and I was looking for cheap performance cellphone and I guess you get what you pay for. Just be aware if you buying this as your main cellphone i do not recommend this refurbished ones, they always will have damage on them, I was expecting minor scratches not big damage like I show on the pictures. Another thing when I open the orders to leave this review the same excellent condition phone price was $20 less than I have pay for in les than 4 hours because I ordered at 11am and was delivered in the afternoon prime same day.",

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2024",
      "body": "The Samsung S21 Ultra has exceeded my expectations in almost every aspect. From its stunning display to its powerhouse performance, this flagship smartphone truly stands out in the crowded market. Let me delve into the details of what makes this device a must-have, while also shedding light on an area that could use some improvement.First and foremost, let's talk about the display. The S21 Ultra boasts a breathtaking Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, delivering unparalleled clarity and vibrancy. Whether I'm streaming my favorite movies or gaming with friends, every visual detail pops with stunning realism. It's like having a cinema in the palm of my hand.Performance-wise, the S21 Ultra is an absolute beast. Powered by the latest Snapdragon processor (or Exynos depending on the region), coupled with generous RAM, this smartphone effortlessly handles multitasking, gaming, and productivity tasks with lightning-fast speed. Apps launch instantly, and I can seamlessly switch between tasks without any lag or stutter.One of the standout features of the S21 Ultra is its camera system. With a quad-camera setup including a 108MP main sensor, 10x optical zoom, and 100x Space Zoom, this phone lets me capture moments with astonishing clarity and detail. Whether it's a scenic landscape or a close-up shot, the photos turn out sharp and vibrant, even in low light conditions.The sleek design of the S21 Ultra is another aspect that I absolutely adore. From its premium build quality to its ergonomic feel in hand, Samsung has nailed the aesthetics of this device. It's a perfect blend of style and functionality, making it a pleasure to use and show off.However, no device is without its flaws, and in the case of the S21 Ultra, it's the included charger. While the smartphone itself supports fast charging up to 25W, the included 2.1A 10W ONLY charger feels somewhat underwhelming. In today's fast-paced world, where every minute counts, having a more powerful charger would significantly enhance the user experience, allowing for quicker top-ups on the go.",

      "body": "Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G, US Version, 128GB, Phantom Black - Unlocked (Renewed) is in Excellent Condition as advertised.  I especially like the 10X optical zoom lens. The camera’s Night Mode setting is capable of photographing night sky constellations.  The camera is capable of saving photos in RAW format by downloading Samsung's RAW App.  Image resolution of the main 1X 108MP camera lens is more grainy than expected.  I'm not sure if it is just a defective main lens in this camera or as a result of software processes such as pixel binning?  The Gorilla Glass screen should prevent display damages.  I think the curved glass edges makes tempered glass screen protectors difficult to stay on and I'm having issues finding a tempered glass that doesn't greatly reduce the sensitivity for this S21 Ultra's fingerprint scanner.  Overall, an impressively designed smartphone by Samsung.",

      "body": "I bought the phone in the condtion Refurbished - Excellent but its not really giving excellent. I've been using it for almost a week and for the most part it does what it's supposed to do. But the phone screen smells like glue. The battery life is NOT 10hrs like the product specs say. A full charge probably lasts like 6hrs😭 But I guess 6hrs can get you through the day. I had an A20s and a full charge on that could last a whole day - 24hrs, so my expectations for the S21 Ultra in that area were not met. The phone also gets a lil too warm for my liking but the phone doesn't alert that it's overheating and battery capacity is still at 5000 mAh so I guess nothing significantly bad happened. Lastly, my phone only came with a cable and no adapter. Had to scavenge for one around the house😭",

I was thinking maybe it just needed to be charged. After I charged it, the screen flashing got worse. I contacted Amazon but Amazon told me to contact the seller. The seller wrote back and said that I was supposed to contact Amazon. So I got the run around for several days. It took almost a month for me to receive my refund but they did refund me in full. I really was disappointed because I was excited about this phone. Now I'm a little wiry about buying a refurbished phone on Amazon anymore. But 3 stars for the refund."

It obviously did not come in original packaging, but I was beyond impressed that it looked like a completely brand new phone! It works great.

      "body": "So as of now I am writing this review after only 1 full day of owning the phone, and so far it seems to be nearly perfect. Now I say nearly because it definitely had one or two things here or there that gave me iffy feelings at first. One example of this is that there were very mild scratches on the side of the camera bump, and while normally that would bother me a lot more, I didn't mind it too much since it wasn't effecting the phones performance, and I put a case over it anyway so I don't see them now. I inserted the sim card from my old phone and it all seems to work just fine with no issues that I am able to see as of this moment, though I hear stories of phones sometimes giving up on the sim card after about a month, so I will have to wait and see on that front. And finally I should say that I have always been incredibly skeptical of buying used phones in general, let alone online, but given the price of the phone and the fairly high standards I set for it I am really rather impressed. If anything I just mentioned happens to change sometime in the near future I will definitely come back and change my review accordingly but until then I will 100% recommend this phone for the price",

That was the only issue with it though, it looked in excellent condition, with no scratches or anything. If I wasn't so bug on the camera I would have kept it but I had to return it for that issue. I would have exchanged but they didn't have any more in stock I had to do a refund. I would buy from here again, I think I just got a dud. The refund process was quick & easy.

They are replacing it for me, so hopefully I get it. It was supposed to arrive 2 days ago. Postponed until today and now today it still hasn't shipped and has been pushed back another 2 days yet again. Meanwhile it's available for two day Prime Shipping and in stock. Yet I'm being told there's a supply issue and a replacement hasn't been shipped after 4 days and says it's gonna take two more.

      "body": "I would start by saying it's not really the fault of the second hand retailer of the phone itself, being that I purchased a renewed phone to begin with. That being said, so far I haven't really been impressed with the camera despite it being one of the major selling points of the phone itself. I noticed a small scratch across one of the lenses but surely that doesn't impact the camera quality and focusing ability that much. My phone's camera doesn't seem quite as capable, again could be due to the fact it's renewed. And likewise the battery life seems to be less than half of what it was claimed to be. The phone body itself was pretty beat up but that's not a big deal since it was thrown straight into an OtterBox. I would say it gets the job done and you get what you pay for. I just wasn't as impressed as I was hoping I would be. The seller did a great job packaging the phone and the delivery was prompt. I would just suggest getting a new one, or at least one in \"like new\" condition if you're considering purchasing one.",

If I had any real complaints it was the fact that the UPS driver that 'delivered' it didn't even get out of his van to knock on the door. I had been waiting for the phone and checking my package tracking only to get told a delivery had been 'attempted' at 1:11 pm.But there was nothing on either of my doors that indicated that they had actually came and knocked on the door. In fact I heard no knocks at all. So they really came to the house, saw they couldn't leave it in the mailbox and took it to the Autoparts store up the street. Not cool.But back to the phone, everything's been working great for a few weeks so far. So i'm pretty happy with it. S-pen functionality is really good too.

      "body": "The phone seems to be great so far. I don't recall seeing any scratches or wear on the phone. It also works great internally so it is truly unlocked!However the charger that came with the phone did not work at all. The charger cord seems to work when paired with another base, but the base seems to be the problem. It's a good thing that I had another wall piece/base to use!Also the cord does not support fast charging. When the chord was attached tp a fast charging base, it would slowly transition from 1.5 hours to 5.5 hours until full charge.Although the phone is renewed, I do expect to be given a proper cord and wall piece as I did not get the full value of my money spent in that regard. Otherwise the phone works great so far. Will update if anything changes.",

I know overall the S21 battery is an issue but this one drains quickly. I'm going to hang on it for a couple more days and may have to return it. It drains to dead off in 5 to 6 hours.Update 5/12/24.....The battery life never improved. Battery got very warm during charging but thought I would just get battery replaced for $100 and not worry about shipping it back and getting credit and all that stuff. Last week I fell into a pool with phone in pocket and immediately pulled it out. Phone wouldn't turn on after that at all. Got it diagnosed for $45 and result was a cooked motherboard. Not the ending I was hoping for. This also is not the fault of the seller in no way at all. The only complaint I have us I wish they would of caught the fact of the battery issue plus the fact it took longer to receive from Amazon than at first stated. I will order another one from Amazon and take a chance since in the past 4 phones I've ordered I never had an issue.",

Hubs wanted to keep images/vids on old phone so he chose dont send images/videos. Moving US Cellular ESim was easy! Took 1 minute! Only issue is USC network for new phones is not their warp network, had to go back to lightspeed. Which is ok bc were on wifi mostly. Hubs phone has 5 small scratches on screen near buttons. Amazon wont give discount only choice is to return.. so \"excellent\" condition was not totally true for 2nd phone same seller. S8+ became unusable super slow always deleting videos or phone froze. Happy to see everything moved over and still tons of room! Two changes..no headphone jack, or SD card expansion. Keeping old phone can use w wifi or store photos. Got a pen for about $10 nice to create note, reminder, handwrite to text. Overall excellent so far!",

I went for the excellent option, and I'd say it was worth the extra. No major scratches, a little dirty but that's okay. However, when I went to turn in this beautiful powerful behemoth, I saw the dreaded At&T logo. After hours of fiddling with the sim card trying to get it to accept my at&t unlocking code, I finally got it to work (without putting in my code?). I managed to disable most of the at&t bloatware but it's still there alright and will probably haunt me. But it connected to Metro by T-Mobile just fine after a online transfer of IMEIs. It works perfectly, the fastest phone Ive ever owned and battery seems to be pretty darn good considering the age of the phone. The 100x zoom is crazy but the camera will need fiddling to get those perfect shots to compete with the pixel. Good phone, not so great experience setting up the phone. Plus is a fast charger was included.",

      "body": "So I absolutely loved this phone for the first 8 months I owned it. I took the time to find the best case for the optional spen (supcase UB Pro), and having the s pen with this phone was an absolute game changer for my organization and photo editing skills...so much functionality. Loved it, especially the handwritten notes you can jot down without having to even turn the phone on.So it was all going great, until it slipped out of my hand and fell 4 inches into a clean toilet bowl. I fished it out right away and dried it off, but I knew the phone comes with an IP68 rating and I had a spigen Neoflex screen protector and the UB Pro case, so I figured my phone would be more than fine. With the protection rating of the bare phone PLUS all the extra protection I carried it in, in my head I was more than fine....Guess again. Phone shorted out within 20 minutes and I got the green screen of death at startup. Completely fried. So that really socks. What the hell is the point of IP68 if a 4\" drop-slide into some water bricks the phone? I have no idea but hopefully my testimony will be a warning to some: treat this phone as if any water will absolutely destroy it, because it just might. I'm still trying to figure out how to sign into my Samsung account on another device without having this one available, because of Samsungs 2FA they ONLY want to send a code to my s21U, which is bricked. So far Samsung customer service has been completely inept",

There are ZERO defects of any kind.  No scratches,  no Knicks, no wear on the corners.  Not even the slightest tiniest little scratch on the screen. This phone legit looks like it was never used.Just a side note,  I'm coming from am S20+ that has SD card slot.  All galaxies after S20 DO NOT HAVE SD CARD SLOTS.  So get the memory size you think you'll need.  I had a 128gb in my S20 and was almost full,  but that was 4 years of use with no factory resets.I would definitely buy again and recommend to anyone that needs a used Phone.",

But then once night the phone slid out of my shorts pocket as I got out of my car. It literally slid down the side of my seat and down the cars door frame and then landed on the ground. My car is about 5.5 inches off the ground, and due to how it slid out of my pocket and down my cars door frame it was essentially a drop of 5.5 inches and the front screen cracked and stopped working and the back cover shattered and started coming apart. I've dropped phones from the top of a refrigerator that took less damage than this phone did from 5 inches. I bought the same model of phone and it is much stronger than whatever glass these guys used to refurbish the phone with. I've never seen anything so fragile in my life.",

I wish there was a good PDF on how to use the camera, the Samsung user guide gives just basics, not a user guide for using the product.It took me hours at the Verizon store for the clerk to get the phone on my Verizon account. I was lucky to get a clerk that stuck with it, I tipped him $40.00 for a good job. Previous to the Verizon clerk getting the phone into the Verizon system, the voice mail icon would not show up if I had a voice mail, thus I missed calls.Great product once up and running!",

It works perfectly with my AT&T Sim card, it sadly doesn't support super fast charging 2.0 compared to my galaxy s20 ultra, however still charges super fast. Hasn't got any scratches yet, but I've only had it for a month. And there is no carrier lock, however once the phone provisioned to my AT&T Sim, it wouldn't work with CDMA such as Verizon whom I use for my work number. Overall 5 stars easy!",

It also doesn't focus as well. The screen seems to struggle with staying bright as well. I am disappointed. Could have gotten a cheaper model if I am getting low camera quality",

      "body": "I would start by saying it's not really the fault of the second hand retailer of the phone itself, being that I purchased a renewed phone to begin with. That being said, so far I haven't really been impressed with the camera despite it being one of the major selling points of the phone itself. I noticed a small scratch across one of the lenses but surely that doesn't impact the camera quality and focusing ability that much. My phone's camera doesn't seem quite as capable, again could be due to the fact it's renewed. And likewise the battery life seems to be less than half of what it was claimed to be. The phone body itself was pretty beat up but that's not a big deal since it was thrown straight into an OtterBox. I would say it gets the job done and you get what you pay for. I just wasn't as impressed as I was hoping I would be. The seller did a great job packaging the phone and the delivery was prompt. I would just suggest getting a new one, or at least one in \"like new\" condition if you're considering purchasing one.",

      "body": "I've had this phone for 2 days now. The phone looks great and works as expected. Unfortunately,  I'm not impressed with the battery life. I know overall the S21 battery is an issue but this one drains quickly. I'm going to hang on it for a couple more days and may have to return it. It drains to dead off in 5 to 6 hours.Update 5/12/24.....The battery life never improved. Battery got very warm during charging but thought I would just get battery replaced for $100 and not worry about shipping it back and getting credit and all that stuff. Last week I fell into a pool with phone in pocket and immediately pulled it out. Phone wouldn't turn on after that at all. Got it diagnosed for $45 and result was a cooked motherboard. Not the ending I was hoping for. This also is not the fault of the seller in no way at all. The only complaint I have us I wish they would of caught the fact of the battery issue plus the fact it took longer to receive from Amazon than at first stated. I will order another one from Amazon and take a chance since in the past 4 phones I've ordered I never had an issue.",

      "body": "So I absolutely loved this phone for the first 8 months I owned it. I took the time to find the best case for the optional spen (supcase UB Pro), and having the s pen with this phone was an absolute game changer for my organization and photo editing skills...so much functionality. Loved it, especially the handwritten notes you can jot down without having to even turn the phone on.So it was all going great, until it slipped out of my hand and fell 4 inches into a clean toilet bowl. I fished it out right away and dried it off, but I knew the phone comes with an IP68 rating and I had a spigen Neoflex screen protector and the UB Pro case, so I figured my phone would be more than fine. With the protection rating of the bare phone PLUS all the extra protection I carried it in, in my head I was more than fine....Guess again. Phone shorted out within 20 minutes and I got the green screen of death at startup. Completely fried. So that really socks. What the hell is the point of IP68 if a 4\" drop-slide into some water bricks the phone? I have no idea but hopefully my testimony will be a warning to some: treat this phone as if any water will absolutely destroy it, because it just might. I'm still trying to figure out how to sign into my Samsung account on another device without having this one available, because of Samsungs 2FA they ONLY want to send a code to my s21U, which is bricked. So far Samsung customer service has been completely inept",

My car is about 5.5 inches off the ground, and due to how it slid out of my pocket and down my cars door frame it was essentially a drop of 5.5 inches and the front screen cracked and stopped working and the back cover shattered and started coming apart. I've dropped phones from the top of a refrigerator that took less damage than this phone did from 5 inches.

The speaker was heavily distorted, making it almost impossible to have a proper conversation, and the screen started to go blank randomly within days of use.When I reached out to their customer service, I provided all the necessary information upfront, but they failed to read or address my concerns properly. Instead of offering a prompt resolution, they were dismissive and unhelpful, leaving me frustrated and without a functioning device.To make matters worse, I had to escalate the issue to Amazon to get any resolution. It was only through Amazon stepping in that I was finally able to address the problem and move forward.I would strongly advise against buying from this company. Their products are unreliable, their customer service is severely lacking, and it’s clear they are not willing to stand behind what they sell. Save yourself the hassle and choose a more reputable and customer-focused busines",

I can see it from over 12 inches. So I could keep it and deal with a much lower resale value should the time come or return and wait for another one that may also be damaged.I read a review here that someone went through five orders before getting one in excellent condition all around, and that was from reseller Chubbiestech. I got my phone from that reseller, so I’m pretty disappointed.Functionally, the phone works fine – from what I can tell from 10 minutes of messing around on it.",

However, there were no missed call notifications on my phone. I begin researching the issue and was told to restart the phone or reset the network settings. I performed these steps and experienced temporary relief. After this issue continued, I contacted the Seller and was told to perform the same steps as above, as well as check for software updates and do a total reset of the phone. Again I performed these steps and only received temporary relief. When I contacted the seller again I was told my order was outside of their \"30 days return window and 90 day warranty. Thus return option is not available.\" They recommended for service, I should contact Samsung or take the phone to local repair professional such as UBREAKIFIX or DIY IFIXIT.Since this is a refurbished phone and the issue is clearly a defect with the phone and not due to my negligence, I believe a satisfactory resolve should be the Seller offering to replace this device with another.",

      "body": "I took my time using this phone in order to give a thorough review. Since this phone is my daily driver, I really can't supply pictures of it but when it comes to the appearance, the phone came pristine. Sides and back glass came pristine, front glass have almost invisible scratches so nothing of note in this front.Performance wise, though, this phone seems to have a really hard time keeping stable mobile signal indoors. I tested this phone on plenty of places and compared to other people's phones around me, and thus, I discarded carrier issues.Looking at forums, there are lots of reports of signal issues. Some people say it happened after the Android 12 update; others say their phones would always have signal issues. In both cases, Samsung had solved the issue by replacing customers' units. Because I'm currently abroad, it's impossible to have the phone RMA'd by amazon. Not saying they wouldn't receive my phone- in other cases their customer service has been top notch, so I assume Amazon would assist me on this.TL;DR: be cautious about refurbished units of this model in particular.UPDATE: Two stars because a smartphone that can't be used as a phone most of the time isn't very smart.",

It worked great for the first 3 months until Samsung did their 6.0 UI undate, then my touch screen would no longer respond. Come to find out not only did the company who sold me the phone use aftermarket products, they used the cheapest ones they could find. And, they hot glued the back on! After contacting the seller since it was only two weeks out of warranty, they said sure, just do a factory reset to clear all your info off the phone and send it back and we'll send you another one. Sounds great, unless you can't get into your phone to do ANYTHING!! So I ended up getting the phone fixed myself, almost 300 dollars later, the phone works like new. Reached out to the seller to see about getting a credit or partial refund and they offered me a $20.00 refund. LOL! I said too little. So just know that if you buy from this company, they use the cheapest aftermarket parks that they can.",

Sometimes it won't connect to any network at all for 30 minutes at a time and then reconnect all of a sudden.  This seems to happen at the most inopportune times when navigating using Google maps and I have to pull over.It won't fast charge at all, even though it says it is fast charging. It will take 7+hrs for a full charge.  You better hope you don't forget to charge it overnight, every single night.  Camera is great, screen quality is great. It would be a good phone if it worked like it is supposed to.  It's my fault for missing the return window but returning anything is a major hassle and don't want to/can't go a day without a phone so I just deal with it now. That said, this is so frustrating and I'm about to just throw it in the trash and get something else.  I would not recommend purchasing a refurb version of this. If you do, be ready to deal with return hassles.",

However, when I asked about the charger Amazon started a return process and wouldn't cancel it. It's been way too frustrating for what should be easy.

      "body": "Purchased phone off Amazon in May 24'. Phone touch-screen went inoperative June 24' with OTA update to 6.1 firmware. It's a complete brick now, because the touch screen does not work!!!None of my local phone repair places can fix it for me, so it's useless. Spent all that money for whats now a paperweight (and I'm past the return window to Amazon by a week naturally).  Thankfully I saved my old beater phone so I have a functioning phone (needed for work! and everything else).No help from Samsung as it was a re-furbed phone with likely an aftermarket replacement screen. If you do buy one of these, do not let it do the OTA update to 6.1!!! If you are savvy with a laptop and re-flashing firmware to an older version, you may be able to un-brick the phone if this happens to you (but you will still lose all data on the phone unless you have been backing it up).Don't know what I will do now, certainly not going to buy another Samsung phone product ever again.",

      "body": "Disappointed with Camera FailureI recently purchased a Samsung phone, expecting a quality camera performance given the brand’s reputation. Unfortunately, the camera failed almost immediately. The app kept crashing every time I tried to open itI tried every troubleshooting tip I could find—restarting the phone, updating software, and even resetting it to factory settings. Nothing helped. It’s deeply frustrating to pay for a phone with a feature that simply doesn’t work. If you’re looking for a phone with a reliable camera, I suggest you look elsewhere. This Samsung device has been a big disappointment.",

Third phone also had a bad speaker. I returned this one too.  Fourth phone I received today. Small nicks on top and side. Speaker works. I am currently waiting on refunds for the other returns.  I will likely returm this one too.  Fifth phone was in excellent condition. No issues at all. Was from Chubbiestech seller on Amazon.  I ordered a total of 6 phones and 2 were in Excellent condition. My recommendation is to not buy Renewed phones from Sold by: thegadgetdeals on Amazon at this time. I ordered another from a different seller Chubbiestech. The phone was in excellent condition. Was packaged well.  Amazon customer service was helpful as always with my returns. Returns have went smoothly except that it does take longer to get a refund being a more expensive item.  I am up to 2 out of 4 phones refunded that I have returned.",
