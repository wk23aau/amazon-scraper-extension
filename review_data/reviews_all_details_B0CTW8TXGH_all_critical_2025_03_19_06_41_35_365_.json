      "body": "I got this for my 11 year old daughter since she lost her other phone , nice size , the functionality is great, it‚Äôs not 5G but the speed works fine for her. We received the phone today so we haven‚Äôt gotten a chance to see how the battery life is as of yet. This phone is light weight & the blue color is nice . For the price I can‚Äôt complain, also it was an easy set up",

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2025",
      "body": "I am writing this as someone who doesn't own a cellphone in the usual sense. I owned the HP iPAQ long before \"smart phones\" where ever though of. Basically, that was a smartphone without the phone. To this day, that is the ONLY reason I own a cellphone - as a pocket computer. I do not activate them, nor do I use them as a phone, so I cannot comment on those aspects. I also disable/uninstall every single google/tracking app/\"feature\" so I cannot comment on those. I CAN discuss this as a computer, though.As a pocket computer, this is fine. It's not great, but that is only because it comes SO loaded with tracking and google-tied services, some of which cannot be disabled. The battery life seems pretty good. The screen is nice and large. I'd prefer it if it were a LITTLE bit wider, but... The camera is much better quality than my old phone.One thing I DO notice, though, is that there seems to be a lag, especially when processing animations. For instance, playing solitaire, there is a slight lag in clicking the deck and the cards turning over. The final animation, where the cards fly around after you win, glitches and lags a bit, there, too. I don't know if my disabling half the phone has anything to do with that, but I wouldn't think so. Speaking of solitaire... the narrow screen aspect makes that pretty hard to see. Unless you play a game that allows rotating the screen.. better put those peeper on!For the price, though, if all you want is a basic, get you by cellphone, especially of you just want to use it as a computer, you could do worse...",

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2025",
      "body": "I like to use a dedicated device for offline maps when exploring National Forest and BLM land (with Gaia GPS).  In the past I've use old phones - they were soooo slow.  I debated about getting a cheap tablet but saw this somehow and decided to give it a try.I saw a review or two that said you could use the phone like a wifi device but nobody confirmed the GPS chip worked without activating cell service.  Well, I am confirming it does.  I did not activate cell service and the GPS chip works in my map apps when in airplane mode.It really is amazing that this phone is $50 normally, and $40 when on sale.  For a use like mine, it is an incredible value.  Heck, the case I use is $12 and over a quarter of the price of the phone itself!  So glad I found this instead of buying a renewed/refurbished flagship that was already outdated.",

      "body": "Was going to purchase an MP3 player but instead got this for $40. It was great for that, comes with stereo which I was surprised. You usually only get one speaker on phones, even some iPhones only have one.The screen leaves a lot to be desired, bad colors, low res and not backlit enough. I'm just using it as a media player so it's not a deal breaker for me. If it was my everyday phone that would get annoying rather quickly.Since it's Android based I was able to use a cracked Spotify APK and Stremio to get all my music and video streaming needs for free. Couldn't do this on my regular iPhone....(This is the 4G model does not have 5G for those who need it, with wifi it's plenty fast for my streaming needs)Battery life has been good, going on 4 days with one single charge. Just been using it to listen to music and the occasional video.",

      "body": "Overall this phone has just been adequate but has some drawbacks. The overall build feels like a 40 dollar phone and doesn't compare top a flagship phone. It is almost entirely made of plastic. That said, it seems durable enough.The screen is clear and bright but I don't know what kind of glass they use but it doesn't seem to be super hard as there are lots of tiny scratches and swirling after only a couple weeks of use and I don't even carry in my pocket a ton.The biggest drawback is in processing speed and power. This phone struggles to keep up with games. It works. It's just choppy. I am replacing a 7 year old galaxy S8 with broken screens on the front and back that hasn't been updated in ages and that phone still outperforms this one.All in all, if its just for texting and normal phone tasks its probably just adequate. Just dont expect too much from it.",

      "body": "For just $50, this phone is an unbeatable value! With 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, it's a great device for the price. While it does come with some pre-installed bloatware, most of the unwanted apps can be easily deleted. Plus, you can use your SafeLink Wireless SIM card with this TracFone, which is a huge bonus. The sound quality is excellent, the cameras are decent, and the phone is surprisingly fast. If you don't mind using Google apps, you'll find a ton of pre-installed options. Overall, I highly recommend this phone - it's a great buy! If you're looking for a SafeLink-compatible device, this is the one to choose.",

It is almost entirely made of plastic. That said, it seems durable enough.The screen is clear and bright but I don't know what kind of glass they use but it doesn't seem to be super hard as there are lots of tiny scratches and swirling after only a couple weeks of use and I don't even carry in my pocket a ton.The biggest drawback is in processing speed and power. This phone struggles to keep up with games. It works. It's just choppy. I am replacing a 7 year old galaxy S8 with broken screens on the front and back that hasn't been updated in ages and that phone still outperforms this one.All in all, if its just for texting and normal phone tasks its probably just adequate. Just dont expect too much from it.",

Struggle to get Tracfone to activate the phone. Struggle to add minutes. Appear to have it set up and working..... next day additional Google/Android hoops to try to jump through.... next day even more hoops... phone won't ring. They can call me, but I can't hear them.... Texting tested good, now doesn't work. I can call them, but it says they are not available, but adds the call to their Recents list. Basically, if you are an Apple/iPhone user (even with years of tech experience).... you are toast. Admittedly, the same may hold for Google/Android users who try Apple/iPhone.Got them a relatively inexpensive ATT Apple/iPhone12 prepay package that has worked well."

      "body": "This phone loves to crash out of apps randomly, the keyboard can take forever to appear at times and will randomly disappear when trying to type. I try and restart it to fix it and that can take as long as 5-7 minutes to do it. And it can take forever to exit an app or online tab. Highly highly recommend to not get this phone if you are looking for a good reliable phone. IT IS CHEAP FOR A REASON!!!!!! Solid example of getting what you pay for."
