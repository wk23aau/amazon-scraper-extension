It is amazing how fast it is and how much better it looks.We are still getting use to them, yet we love them.My husband got the S25 with the 256 memory I think it is and I got the S25 Ultra with the I think 512 memory.He didn't want a phone much bigger than his old S9 and I wanted a phone bigger than the S9.Mine isn't huge yet it definitely makes the regular one look smaller when I use his.They look sleek and very nice!!They are fast and I don't have any issues with lag or anything like that.",

      "body": "I am an older person (65) and for yrs went to a phone store so I could have data transferred from my old phone to my new phone; and of course paying premium $$$ for the phone and the service.  NOT anymore!!  I bought this new Samsung and upon charging it literally walked me through Step-by-Step on how to transfer my phone data, contacts, apps, etc...and keeping my phone number.  I also received $200.00 from Amazon!!  So getting the best phone on the market at a great deal!!  I am not tech savvy AT ALL, so was so proud that I took this small leap of faith to do it myself (it was one of the easiest tech things I have ever done) and saved several hundred dollars by doing so!!  Love this phone!  The Camera takes excellent pictures and videos and the features are great!  Love also that I got back $200.00 Amazon gift card!!",

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2025",
      "body": "I love this device, but I have a suggestion for the professional camera. Please consider a camera update that allows for full manual adjustments, utilizing all the capabilities of the hardware. Currently, there are limits in place. For example, in astrophotos using the raw camera, the ISO can only be manually adjusted up to 3200, while AI allows it to go up to 8000. Although editing is possible afterward, I would prefer to set the camera for an optimal professional photo according to my preferences and the hardware's capabilities. Offering both options—AI & auto, and a fully manual mode without limits—would be fantastic. If anyone has been able to make all adjustments manually, please share your experience.",

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2025",
      "body": "This product locked up while using the camera app and subsequently entered an infinite boot loop 5 days after initial use. The phone would get very hot, and restarting would only allow it to shut down for 60 seconds, upon which it would begin the boot process, only to get stuck on the initial black samsung screen, again, and again. The only thing I could do was wait until the battery physically ran to zero, which was a long time, and then try again the next day, when i discovered that the problem was still present. Amazon was very helpful, and almost immediately issued a full refund due to a manufacturer defect. I am posting this because this is a new product, and hopefully it will help someone else that runs into the same problem. I will try again with a local store, and hope that this is just a one off problem.",

      "body": "I upgraded from an S21, and dang this phone is nice! Better camera, better speakers, sharper screen. It's very, very snappy. But the S21 was fast too. I only have one gripe, and once Samsung fixes it I'll come back and change my review to five stars... It's no longer possible to have a 4x5 grid pattern on the home screens. The only options now are 4x6 or 5x6. I read in one forum that eventually it will be possible? I'm hoping that's the case. I thought the phone was going to be better in every regard but this particular limitation is a step down for me. Anyway great phone overall!Update: I've been using this phone for 5 days now and screw it, I'm moving my review to five stars even though I still can't do the 4x5 grid. This phone is amazing.2nd update: Not really an update, just that I forgot to mention how easy it is to transition from one Samsung to another. Literally all my apps on the other phone were downloaded to the new phone, it was so freaking easy to make the transition.",

      "body": "I upgraded from a S22 and this phone has many more bells and whistles, especially as it relates to AI and effortless completion of tasks. The data transfer goes very smoothly and the phone leads you through the steps easily. But here is what they do not tell you: the data transfer does not transfer anything you have paired and it does not transfer logons and passwords for all of the Apps transferred. There is still a massive amount of work to do to get to the smooth operation of your previous phone. Battery life is definitely better with this phone. I am pleased with the purchase.",

And movement registered by the palm, caused the phone to cancel out your actual taps. So like Steve said a decade ago…”you’re holding it wrong” or it just sucks.Screen is vivid… but as always blow out many of the photos and videos you view on screen….something to keep in mind as your photos will look differently on a computer or on an iPhone.Most annoying - WiFi drops suddenly or when not in use for a bit. Usually it’ll reconnect in a second on my iPhone…takes over a minute on the s25. Very annoying when low cell coverage.And worst of all…why buy at this price if next week Amazon will discount this for 100 dollars ? Not going to get hit with the lower price 31 days later…",

The curved edges make a big difference.As for the look of the phone - i like it. Many like the boxy look of the 24 ultra but i don't have any issues.So far my only complaint is the removal of Bluetooth for s pen and software update.It is an utterly poor excuse from Samsung for removing that feature even though they claim less than 1 percent uses it.Just because i do not use my spare tire on my car regularly does not mean i do not want it on my vehicle. When i do need it i am happy that its there when i need it. Sammy should fix this ASAPAs for software......it is February and the phone is still on December patch.....Overall though....great device",

      "body": "I switched from a Galaxy S20+ to this. I wasn't going to do that, but my phone got the vertical stripe, and I didn't want to invest more into it, so...All these years I have lamented the quality of my photos from the S20+. Sure, with a casual glance, they're fine. But zooming in, or telephoto shots, and the pixelation is so bad.I've pick this phone (25 Ultra) with the hope of far better pics. I'm still checking that out, but what I like right off the bat, is the \"Remaster\". This AI rework on my past photos is great (not perfect, of course, but sure helps in some instances).I'm trying out the AI voice interaction, and it's growing on me a little. Probably not worth the cost to buy, but I picked this hopefully to have better pics.Added 3/3/25: I've been taking pictures and finding that this Ultra does a much better job. See photos: the first is normal (wide-angle 23mm), the 2nd is 10x telephoto. Much better than my old S20+.",

The weight compared to the S22 Ultra does not feel much difference, however in image quality and functions takes light years to that model.Since day 1 I have enjoyed it very much. The only thing I notice to date is that certain touch functions are stuck in certain applications such as Instagram or I do not know if the app is the problem itself.I'm looking forward to see what else it brings in features to get the most out of it."

      "body": "Love the hardware. It's probably the most complete smartphone package in this form factor in early 2025.The software is another story. First of all, it comes with a good bit of crapware installed. A handful of Microsoft apps are there (which you can thankfully permanently remove). There's a ton of Samsung apps which you can unfortunately not remove. I don't need nor want Samsungs Browser, or their health apps, or most of the other Samsung branded apps that come preloaded on this phone that you can't remove.One UI 7 isn't terrible, but you'll probably be better served by another launcher. At least you can switch that.Overall, I think the Pixel 9 series phones offer a more cohesive software experience. The only way I'd opt for this over them is if you have used and like Samsungs phones and apps, and want a phone for gaming (for which the Snapdragon X Elite chip is better for than the Tensor G4 in the Pixels).",

The phone would get very hot, and restarting would only allow it to shut down for 60 seconds, upon which it would begin the boot process, only to get stuck on the initial black samsung screen, again, and again. The only thing I could do was wait until the battery physically ran to zero, which was a long time, and then try again the next day, when i discovered that the problem was still present. Amazon was very helpful, and almost immediately issued a full refund due to a manufacturer defect. I am posting this because this is a new product, and hopefully it will help someone else that runs into the same problem. I will try again with a local store, and hope that this is just a one off problem.",

      "body": "Love the hardware. It's probably the most complete smartphone package in this form factor in early 2025.The software is another story. First of all, it comes with a good bit of crapware installed. A handful of Microsoft apps are there (which you can thankfully permanently remove). There's a ton of Samsung apps which you can unfortunately not remove. I don't need nor want Samsungs Browser, or their health apps, or most of the other Samsung branded apps that come preloaded on this phone that you can't remove.One UI 7 isn't terrible, but you'll probably be better served by another launcher. At least you can switch that.Overall, I think the Pixel 9 series phones offer a more cohesive software experience. The only way I'd opt for this over them is if you have used and like Samsungs phones and apps, and want a phone for gaming (for which the Snapdragon X Elite chip is better for than the Tensor G4 in the Pixels).",

      "body": "Dear Samsung, you need to add back old features and introduce new hardware upgrades to sell more of  your premium smartphones.First, after mocking Apple for removing 3.5mm headphone jack in their commercials Samsung decided to do the same thing. Probably to sell more wireless earbuds. We can buy Xperia 1 VI as a flagship that still has 3.5mm headphone jack and microSD card slot, but it's a last year model so can wait for this years release from Sony.Then they removed microSD card slots. Probably to charge more for storage upgrade.Now they removed Bluetooth functionality on the stylus. We used the stylus as a remote for taking pictures and controlling other apps on previous Samsung models.Still glass back that is very fragile and slippery - you can easily crack it if you drop the phone.  Using fragile glass makes a phone more prone to serious damage and you would be more inclined to upgrade your phone. For example if were to trade your old Samsung Note 20 Ultra 5g to preorder a new S25 Ultra, and the back has a small crack that doesn't affect functionality of your phone - you will get much less money $300 vs $600, even though the screen is not cracked. Other manufacturers like Motorola and One plus use different materials that feel more premium, not slippery and much more durable. One Plus 13 used microfiber vegan leather.  Samsung, please learn from your competitors.No battery upgrade. Some reviewers notice decreased battery life when you play YouTube videos, because of more powerful processor and. Many other manufactures are upgrading their flagship batteries this year. One plus 13 has  6,000 mAh battery capacity, with a new battery technology, to support more powerful processor, while Samsung only has 5,000 mAh with the old technology.There are so many great alternatives if you don't need a stylus. VivoX200 has a better battery and camera not as easy to buy in the US. One plus 13, not as good of a camera but everything else is better than S25 Ultra. And there are going to be phones coming out this year with much better specs.Samsung expects us to pay $1300 for a phone that is inferior to the more affordable competitors.Samsung used to be great and I hope they can listen to their customers, do better, and become a true leader in the premium smartphone segment.",

It isn't even an upgrade from its predecessor's predecessor.In it at least one way, it's a massive downgrade. For some reason the ability to customize individual app notification sounds has been removed from the OS. If the apps themselves had this feature built in this wouldn't be an issue, but few of them do. As a result, the default system notification sound is the notification sound for everything. Want to make sure the app that tells you when your prescription is ready at the pharmacy sounds different from the one that tells you your laundry is done, because some things are more important than others? You can't. Everything sounds the same.Making matters worse, when I transferred the settings from my old phone, all of my custom notification sounds were removed. Not replaced with the system notification sound, removed entirely. Replaced with silence. Every single app I set up a custom notification sound for now has no notification sound.and of course there's no way to set one up anymore.I don't know if this was something Google decided to do with Android 15, or if it's something Samsung decided to do with One UI. If Samsung did it and they don't fix it, this is my last Samsung phone, ever. If Google did it, then I'm done with android. This is an enormous step backward in usability, and I can't believe somebody thought it was a good idea.Don't buy this phone. In fact, it's probably best not to buy any phone with One UI 7 or Android 15. Find a nice used phone or an older model instead.",

      "body": "Screen sucks, plain and simple. The S25U I recieved has a grainy screen. This happened when I tried out the S24U as well last year, and I even reviewed that one here as well. Apparently, this is just a hardware quirk of whatever display technology they are using now. And no, the S23U and Fold Z 5 and below do not have these problems. They have amazing screens, the kind thay Samsung used to be known for. It's a shame, because the rest of the device is pretty great. But if you're spending this much money, everything should be better than previous models, including the screen. Please avoid this device.",

      "body": "I had a Samsung s10e which for anyone who had one is the best phone EVER,  but it's not satellite capable so I had to get a new phone. I picked the Samsung S25 because it was the closest in size. Well I hate it.  First the s20e was all soft edges and smooth lines like Zen Garden, this thing is like an anorexic brick. You can tell Samsung thought Apple made a better phone because now Samsung phones look just like Apple phones, if I wanted an Apple I would  have bought one.  The screen is so slippery it is hard to drop and drag and looks super fragile. And I had it plugged in all night,  yes with Samsung approved equipment, and it only got up to 79%. It is only 3 days old and after typing just this review it is down to 70%.  I read online that show charging is a big problem. The bottom camera lens is right where my finger likes to be so it is full of finger prints already. No SD card for storage and while i got the 256 GB model,  with all my pictures and videos I am already half full.  I hate that there is no earphone jack. All in all not an upgrade from my last phone and I feel like I have been locked in a box after running free in the fields.  I am going to be looking at other phones. I wish my S10e were satellite compatible because I would have kept it forever."

      "body": "Very dissappointing after 10 years with Samsung.  This is basically an S24 ultra with a less useful S Pen(no bluetooth so no air gestures or shutter control).  The processor is slightly better.  Charging speed is 3 years behind other phones.  I got a OnePlus 13 that's very impressive for $400 less, brighter screen, bigger battery, much faster charging, and so far it's had better performance than my Samsung phones.  Samsung seems to have a slight edge in the camera at very high zoom, but that's about it.",
