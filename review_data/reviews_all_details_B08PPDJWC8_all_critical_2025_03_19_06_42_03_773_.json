      "body": "I rarely write reviews, but in this case, I think people should be warned. I‚Äôve been through four of these phones in a couple months, and they have all had major issues from Camera not working to audio issues, and the worst of all one COMPLETELY DIED after four months.Unfortunately, the Amazon warranty is only three months. (I thought it was one year because other competitors offer that. But it does clearly say on their page that it‚Äôs only three months.) During these three months, they to completely refund you no problem or fix the issue that you report. But unfortunately the phone I kept died on month four, while I was on vacation to make matters worse.Seems like the sellers are always different stores, but all amazon approved and they follow some sort of Amazon standards for these phones. But it seems to me that these phones have really severe issues so these Amazon sellers fix the phones to a certain standard, but they are not in good condition.All the sellers are polite and responsive, but the issue is the actual phones and their conditions. Even though these phones are used, they are not cheap, they should function properly.I‚Äôve been an Amazon customer for years and I really haven‚Äôt had any issue with them. That was the reason why I decided to buy the used phone on Amazon instead of a competitor. But this is truly disappointing to the point that I think I‚Äôm going to report them to the Better Business Bureau. They should not be selling phones in this condition.FULL STORYPhone 1: iPhone 12 mini (Ordered good condition )Received Mid OctoberSeller: Kojak salesWhen I receive the phone physically it seems fine. But as soon as I put a case on it, a lot of little pieces of paint started coming off of it and then you could tell it had a lot of scratches on the case so somebody was trying to cover the scratches, then I put a screen protector on it, and after trying to I could not get rid of a humongous huge bubble, took a third of the screen. So some thing was hinting to me that the screen was not straight. In my opinion, the phone shouldn‚Äôt have been sold as good condition with so many scratches but since I don‚Äôt care about the look as much as functionality, I move forward. But then, after a few weeks of using the phone, I realized things were not working properly. The camera was very slow at taking pictures if it was dark or if you were using inside the message or WhatsApp. Also, if I received a text while listening to videos or video calls, the speaker would suddenly gets super low, and I could barely hear the video for about two minutes . (usually this lowering of audio feature happens only for five or 10 seconds).This was worrying me so I contacted the seller and told him I wanted to change the phone and he said no problem. Since I was still thinking that this was bad luck, but in general, I liked the iPhone 12 I decided to buy another phone as a replacement, and one more phone as a Christmas gift. I‚Äôll explain below the problems with those phones, but since the problems were actually worse than the current first phone I had in my possession, I never gave back this phone. I kept thinking that maybe the issues would get better with update and also, in my mind, I thought I had a year warranty. Unfortunately, in February while away on vacation the phone one morning, simply never turned on again. My dad is an engineer and he tried helping me connect it to computer and nothing it‚Äôs like the battery is no longer connected. I‚Äôm sure you can imagine the horrendous time I had the following week without my phone., traveling.. Things got worse when I got home and was able to contact the seller. I then discovered the warranty was only 90 days and that date had passed. After some back-and-forth the seller Kojak sales said they can fix it for $39 and I pay for shipping. I have still not done this since I‚Äôm skeptical and don‚Äôt understand how they can give me a price if they don‚Äôt even know the actual problem or if they need parts. But I really have no other option, or I lose $241 or I pay $60 more. (also, I have to figure out how to erase the phone from a PC if the phone doesn‚Äôt even turn on. I‚Äôm sad I‚Äôm gonna lose all my pictures from the last four months)After I send them the phone, I will update this review.-Phone 2 and 3- iPhone 12 mini (Ordered good condition )Received Mid  begging of decemberSeller: WilzeeSo one of these phones was supposed to be replacement for my phone and the second phone was gonna be a Christmas gift. But the first one was so scratch that I didn‚Äôt even set it up and I gave it back, no problem and the other phone after giving it as a gift, a little embarrassed with all the scratches, we set it up and realized the camera did not focus at all so I also gave this phone back and received a refund no issue.-4th Phone-  iPhone 12 mini (Ordered EXCELLENT condition )Received mid JanuarySeller: PDI MobileThis phone did actually look really good in the outside barely any scratches. I was very happy with the look. But after setting it up again, the camera could not focus so we contacted the seller and sent it back and they fix the camera then after a few weeks of using also, it has audio issues. We‚Äôre looking at social media videos suddenly that audio lowers  a lot. Since at this my 1st phone died suddenly we decided to give this 4th phone back. I don‚Äôt wanna take any chances since the quality of the phones is clearly not good. I don‚Äôt expect an issue with the refund. But I will update this review if I do.",

      "body": "Cliff notes:-GREAT price-No/minimal cosmetic damage-77% battery health (not ideal)-Efficient customer service resolved issuesI'm upgrading from an iPhone SE so this feels like a massive jump! I believe I purchased a phone in \"Good Condition\" for $195. The phone, cosmetically, was perfect! No noticeable scratches on the screen or the cameras. There is a tiny little chip on the border/metal but once a case is on, you don't even notice it. Amazon guarantees all phones will have battery health of at least 80%, but mine came at 77%. I contacted the seller who recommended I return the phone and they will send a replacement. I really didn't want to have to wait another 2 weeks or so to have a new phone (my SE is glitching like crazy) so this was less than ideal. I proposed a partial refund and was able to get a refund for 20% of the price. (I'm upgrading from an SE with 82% battery health and have no issues with battery life. I've gotten used to carrying a charger around with me everywhere. Even at 77%, this 12 mini has a longer battery life haha). Overall, I think I spent 15 minutes chatting with customer service so it wasn't a huge burden or hassle. I really do appreciate that.  So was the item as described? No, but I feel like it was made right. The phone came with a non-authentic charging cord but no wall plug. Not really an issue since I already own a charger for my current phone, but it's worth noting.  Overall, $150 doesn't seem like a bad price for a phone!",

      "body": "Being annoyed by iPhone size creep, I decided on a 12 mini to get back to a pocket-able device.  Always missed my 4S that you could stick in a shirt pocket.  If I want to screen big enough to read a book I'll grab an iPad.  This is small and light enough to take everywhere and hardly notice it.  Having said that it replaced an iPhone 8 and the screen actually measures slightly larger than the 8 does since it doesn't have a border at the top and bottom.Am pleased with the quality of the renewed device; it came with barely a scratch, maybe a little rubbing on one edge but not noticeable with the Otter case on it.  No scratches or flaws on the face glass.  The battery shows 85% capacity which I was disappointed about at first but seems to be better than what many other reviewers are reporting.  The phone arrived 3 days earlier than the estimate which was nice.  Came with a charge cable as advertised.Rated down a star not for any quality issue but because the price dropped by $10 during the time I ordered it and the day it arrived.",

      "body": "This is a brilliant phone. Yes, it is a few generations down from the newest, and yes these are specifically refurbished as well. Even so! My phone arrived in basically new condition a year ago, and has worked well since.Battery life is...not amazing, but Iphones honestly don't have great battery life. They'll last you through the day depending on your use, but not much past that. That's fine, I charge mine often.64GB's is plenty for a phone unless you are recording often and keeping a large gallery or a ton of apps.I like the smaller size of the phone, I think phones are getting too big, and this has all the features of a big phone in the smaller package. I like the facial recognition (although it feels dystopian) as it makes unlocking the phone a breeze. I think the camera is very passable, and I like the screen. If not for being worried about dropping it, the outer case is beautiful. Apple outdid themselves.What I don't like. The size...is actually still a bit too big for me. The Iphone SE (1st Generation) used the Iphone 5 frame. I thought that frame was truly amazing, as it wasn't very big at all. Easy to one hand, almost as if designed to be. It in fact *WAS* designed to be. When I first got it, I realized this. It is too big to one hand comfortably, it's not quite so big that 2 hands feels truly right. It's fine, but I feel the mini should have been actually a touch smaller. Also, I honestly kinda dislike having almost all the phone's front be the screen. There's nowhere good to rest your hand to support it without touching the screen. I used to wrap my hand around the phone and support it with my thumb across the front, near where the button was. It's a nitpick, but I just don't dig it as much.For $200~275 though, is it worth it? Ab-so-lutely. It's a great phone, I bought mine I think for near double that, and I only somewhat regretted the price tag. It's held up very nice the past year, and I don't expect to have to replace it for a good number. If not for the busted screen on my old phone, I'd still be rocking it despite a truly not good battery. This one makes for a fine replacement, and if you want a new Iphone, this is the one to get.",

A full charge lasts for about 6 hours if you only browse the internet (on WiFi), play music and watch videos.

      "body": "The iPhone 12 mini is a fantastic phone for those who prioritize size and one-handed usability. It's still a capable performer with a great camera and display. However, the battery life is a significant consideration. If you're a heavy user or need the latest and greatest features, you might want to look at newer models. But if you're on a budget and want a truly pocketable phone, the 12 mini is still worth considering, especially on the used market.",

      "body": "Scratch resistant: The phone by itself can easily get scratched on the sides and just one drop itself can leave a noticeable scratch/mark if you drop it somewhere like the street or crossroad by accident.Screen: The screen feels very smooth if you are upgrading from something less newer. Easy to play games on if you have small hands as well as type. I recommend a screen protector cause every iPhone to ever exist is easy to get scratches without you even noticing.Battery: My phone came with 87% battery health and I was fine with it until within just a week or so it went down to 85%. That‚Äôs my only real problem with this phone.Camera: The quality is amazing so if you take pictures this will satisfy most of your needs. It‚Äôs definitely more than worth it if you‚Äôre looking to upgrade to something better or newer.Appearance: I personally got the red color and it looks amazing and brand new. The phone comes in a box with a SIM card opener pin, charger without cube, paper with information about the phone and seller, and the phone is inside a little bag.**Although it might not be important but if you for example get the 128 GB and you have the latest IOS update that means you‚Äôll have 10GB less due to the software. So you‚Äôll be left with 108GB or at least somewhere around that area**",

I made sure both were from the seller MOBILESUPPLY as they had the best and most reviews.The black one I got in 3 days time from New York and the second one came in the next day after purchase !I purchased 2 of 3 for Christmas gifts for my children who will use these as WiFi phones.Our home has WiFi, schools and most stores we go to have WiFi as well as our car.I have also taken MY SIM card out of my phone and put them in the purchased phones and it works just fine to make calls etc.The condition of both of the iPhone 12 mini I purchased is immaculate condition and the battery health is above 80%. I selected the ‚ÄúEXCELLENT Condition‚Äù.Any particles seen in the photo/video are dust.This comes with a generic cube & charger so be sure to get a screen protector and case.Unfortunately, it will be about a month before my kids can actually start using the phone to see if there are any issues etc.The phones I purchased updated and are compatible with the newest iOS 18 update and working just fine when I set them up .I purchased black , green and soon I will be purchasing purple as soon as MOBILESUPPLY has it in stock.I am definitely a review person and I WILL be certain to come back and update ANY issues.If you do not see an update then that means my review remains at 5 stars!I will add the green and purple photos soon but I wanted to get this review posted for others before Christmas .

      "body": "Ordered based off of other reviews.  Was time to get our 12 year old his first phone.  A new iPhone with my carrier was $1,000 with no existing phone to trade in.  Took a chance on Amazon Renewed iPhone 12 Mini.  At this price, if we lost it, broke it, or whatever- it was a good business case.  Phone was sent FedEx shipping and had it in one day.  You couldn't tell the phone was ever used.  Came with pre-installed screen protector with no \"bubbles\"- better than I could have installed one honestly.  Packaging was supurb, and came with a used charging brick in great condition, and what appeared to be a new charging cable to match.  Phone stated it was unlocked.  Tried to add new line with phone to my carrier plan and ran into issue.  Called carrier, and they did a few resets to the carrier profile of the phone, and verified it was unlocked.  Within 30 minutes had the phone up and running.  Box stated the battery to be 85%, and that was verified in the phone's settings to be correct.  No issues at all, phone holds a full charge alomst as well as any new iPhone I have ever purchased for 4x the cost.  Did not have high hopes for Renewed, but turns out this was like getting a pretty much new device, so my expectations were far exceeded.  Told my wife I would not hesitate to go this route on another Renewed iPhone when my existing iPhone is paid off with my carrier, and save a monthly equipment payment going forward.  Sure it is not the latest iPhone, but honestly- most of the improvements that the end-user really sees every year is in the camera- not so much a fancy new chip with marginal speed improvements on the same phone form factor.  Is that worth $1,000 a year- that is a personal decision.  Great purchase experience and value.  For purchasing a phone for a teenager where you are worried about losing or breaking, this is a great option that one should explore before plunking down money on a risky purchase with a new carrier phone financed over 2-years.  Also saves paying up to $20 a month for an insurance plan on said phone.",

This \"reconditioned\" or \"refurbished\" (EXCELLENT) phone truly looked brand-new.I've been using it for 3 days now, and it takes some getting used to, to navigate around the screens, finding your websites, tools, apps, etc. And CLOSING THEM is different, too. There's no more \"home\" button on the bottom center like my old phone.As for battery life, it seems to charge more quickly than my iPhone 7 did, but it still uses up the battery just as fast.  Today I started with 100% power at 7 am and didn't make a single call, but did a few texts (with a couple of attached photos) and did browse a few websites.  By 10 a.m. my battery was down to 80 percent.  Of course the phone came with one 120V wall charger and a cord, and all my other iPhone and iPad charging cables work with this one too.",

      "body": "The iPhone 12 mini, refurbished was visually in great condition. Purchased in September 2024. The touchscreen didn‚Äôt seem sensitive enough. I tried changing settings, but still bothersome, especially around the edges. After warranty was out, several issues began with the battery. The first month or so, it required charging twice a day, with or without excessive use. I liked the size so much and the fact text messaging was a breeze, I tolerated it. December 2024- Then the battery began getting really hot. The touchscreen stopped responding. I removed the cover and even took the screen protector off (I was panicking)! I forced it to power down. After powering up again, I ran it in low power mode, which seemed to help and kept the phone functional. January 2025 - The phone would say it wasn‚Äôt charged, plug in and it indicated 70 - 89% charged; unplug, 2 -3%. Phone gave a message: Battery not recognized. Look in explanation, the battery is not Apple and may be incompatible. Next day, thankfully, it upgrades. Since then, screen sensitivity is much better and the battery seems ok. It doesn‚Äôt need charging as often. I just really enjoy that text messages are sent and received so easily and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm carrying around a mammoth of a phone.  It also seems faster on the internet. Those are the reasons that I gave 2 stars. Also, it‚Äôs in a case and the screen has several cracks, from low level drops. This might be an Apple issue. The only other electronic device that I own that has cracked, is an iPad. No cracks on any of my android refurbished phones. In fact, I still have two around the house to use for shopping, internet searches, etc. This may just be the ‚Äúluck of the draw‚Äù and I just happened to get a lemon. I‚Äôm going to try to limp along until at least a year, just to not feel too bad about spending the money. But when I buy, it will DEFINITELY be Android!"

      "body": "Cosmetically excellent. Functionally perfect. However arrived with only 82% battery health. The advertisement guaranteed 80% or more so it did met its minimum as stated, but of course hoped for better (especially since this model isn't known for the longest battery life even when new). Would I do it again? = Probably. Should you do it? = not sure as every used iPhone is used and has a unique history of use and abuse and every refurbishment is done just enough to get unit up to minimum specifications so one used phone may not be fully indicative of what another is. If you get a dud you'd probably realize it soon and be able to erase and return. Since i was comfortable with the tech of knowing I was buying the right unit for my network, changing SIM cards and updating software, for me it seems like a better value than $1000 for a new phone. Overall mildly positive rating.",

It was placed inside a box loosely then put into an envelope that was lined with bubble wrap. However, upon inspection, the outer appearance was flawless! There was not a single scratch anywhere, not even the screen.Once I got the phone powered on and switched on with my carrier, I noticed the battery health was at 85%. This is lower than I was expecting, but it wasn‚Äôt a dealbreaker. I have used the phone vigorously and to my surprise, it has held up quite well. I do have to leave the Power Saver on for the battery life to last me throughout the day.  I know this isn‚Äôt normal for an iPhone, but for being an old-ish model and since I am used to using a cheap android that has terrible battery life, I don‚Äôt mind having to charge it throughout the day. Especially since it is a wireless charger. I can throw it on a portable power supply and call it good.Overall, I am content with my purchase.",

I didn‚Äôt realize that at the beginning. I kept waiting for the Quick Start screen to pop up. Eventually, I realized that I needed to erase this brand new phone to get it back to factory settings. Once I did that, the Quick Start screen popped up and things worked as they were supposed to. (Actually, I had to erase it three times. The transfer didn‚Äôt work the first time because I guess I wasn‚Äôt properly connected to appleID on the old phone [that doesn‚Äôt complete make sense to me now but that was my conclusion at the time].

      "body": "i've never ever written a review on amazon everr before, but i had to leave one for this. my 11 broke on me a few days ago, and i needed a new phone for cheap ASAP. there were a few bad reviews on this that made me a little bit skeptical.. but once i got the phone i fell in love!i ordered the 12 mini in green and it came in perfect condition, literally sparkling when i opened the box. the screen was clean and perfect, and i saw no physical issue at all. the box came in with a lighting cable (along with the phone) which was sweet.i was also worried about battery life/health and prayed that it would be above 80% at least. so when i checked and it was at 82% i was relieved. not the absolute best, but i'm not complaining because of the awesome price.if you're thinking of buying, i say go for it!! the 12 mini is so cute and pretty stable/sturdy in my opinion (i played roblox on it already). i'll be buying phones (if necessary) on amazon renewed from now on as well :))",

      "body": "I bought an Iphone 12 mini in \"excellent\" condition first. All scratched up and if look very decently used. Did not care much, since I just want to use it as dashcam. Battery was at 100%- meaning it was replaced. Good and bad... since I got a message that the camera was not genuine also. So phone was damaged. Camera and battery were replaced. Problem is they got replaced with non-genuine parts. While I have nothing against aftermarket parts when I have to replace them, I have an issue when someone sells something and not disclosing that. I would rather have an old non genuine battery than a new aftermarket. Also the way Apple has been working lately what's from stopping them disabling my non genuine camera. They try doing it before I believe people were outraged and they stopped and even a law- The right to repair was also introduced because of that. Either way bought another refurb phone after returning this one. That one I got it with the lowest possible condition- \"acceptable\" or something. Also, the cheapest. Honestly as far as scratches they look identical. This one battery was at 88%- so it hasn't been replaced and no messages about non genuine parts. So I guess my advice would be to go in with a lot of expectations about these and my opinion just get the cheapest possible. Chances are you will still get the same condition unit.",

I am a very skeptical person and buying a refurbished phone online was always a little nerve racking for me but this phone has exceeded all my expectations so far. I trust cell surfers and you should to it was fast free shipping and they provided me with a return shipping label if I needed to send it back for any reason. Ships from the USA so I received it in 2 days. I have recommended this phone and company to everyone recently and am very happy with my purchase thus far. Will update if anything changes. If you are skeptical like me take the leap its worth it and if I doesn‚Äôt turn out like you expected they have the same return policy as Amazon so you can trust them. Great purchase!",

      "body": "I rarely write reviews, but in this case, I think people should be warned. I‚Äôve been through four of these phones in a couple months, and they have all had major issues from Camera not working to audio issues, and the worst of all one COMPLETELY DIED after four months.Unfortunately, the Amazon warranty is only three months. (I thought it was one year because other competitors offer that. But it does clearly say on their page that it‚Äôs only three months.) During these three months, they to completely refund you no problem or fix the issue that you report. But unfortunately the phone I kept died on month four, while I was on vacation to make matters worse.Seems like the sellers are always different stores, but all amazon approved and they follow some sort of Amazon standards for these phones. But it seems to me that these phones have really severe issues so these Amazon sellers fix the phones to a certain standard, but they are not in good condition.All the sellers are polite and responsive, but the issue is the actual phones and their conditions. Even though these phones are used, they are not cheap, they should function properly.I‚Äôve been an Amazon customer for years and I really haven‚Äôt had any issue with them. That was the reason why I decided to buy the used phone on Amazon instead of a competitor. But this is truly disappointing to the point that I think I‚Äôm going to report them to the Better Business Bureau. They should not be selling phones in this condition.FULL STORYPhone 1: iPhone 12 mini (Ordered good condition )Received Mid OctoberSeller: Kojak salesWhen I receive the phone physically it seems fine. But as soon as I put a case on it, a lot of little pieces of paint started coming off of it and then you could tell it had a lot of scratches on the case so somebody was trying to cover the scratches, then I put a screen protector on it, and after trying to I could not get rid of a humongous huge bubble, took a third of the screen. So some thing was hinting to me that the screen was not straight. In my opinion, the phone shouldn‚Äôt have been sold as good condition with so many scratches but since I don‚Äôt care about the look as much as functionality, I move forward. But then, after a few weeks of using the phone, I realized things were not working properly. The camera was very slow at taking pictures if it was dark or if you were using inside the message or WhatsApp. Also, if I received a text while listening to videos or video calls, the speaker would suddenly gets super low, and I could barely hear the video for about two minutes . (usually this lowering of audio feature happens only for five or 10 seconds).This was worrying me so I contacted the seller and told him I wanted to change the phone and he said no problem. Since I was still thinking that this was bad luck, but in general, I liked the iPhone 12 I decided to buy another phone as a replacement, and one more phone as a Christmas gift. I‚Äôll explain below the problems with those phones, but since the problems were actually worse than the current first phone I had in my possession, I never gave back this phone. I kept thinking that maybe the issues would get better with update and also, in my mind, I thought I had a year warranty. Unfortunately, in February while away on vacation the phone one morning, simply never turned on again. My dad is an engineer and he tried helping me connect it to computer and nothing it‚Äôs like the battery is no longer connected. I‚Äôm sure you can imagine the horrendous time I had the following week without my phone., traveling.. Things got worse when I got home and was able to contact the seller. I then discovered the warranty was only 90 days and that date had passed. After some back-and-forth the seller Kojak sales said they can fix it for $39 and I pay for shipping. I have still not done this since I‚Äôm skeptical and don‚Äôt understand how they can give me a price if they don‚Äôt even know the actual problem or if they need parts. But I really have no other option, or I lose $241 or I pay $60 more. (also, I have to figure out how to erase the phone from a PC if the phone doesn‚Äôt even turn on. I‚Äôm sad I‚Äôm gonna lose all my pictures from the last four months)After I send them the phone, I will update this review.-Phone 2 and 3- iPhone 12 mini (Ordered good condition )Received Mid  begging of decemberSeller: WilzeeSo one of these phones was supposed to be replacement for my phone and the second phone was gonna be a Christmas gift. But the first one was so scratch that I didn‚Äôt even set it up and I gave it back, no problem and the other phone after giving it as a gift, a little embarrassed with all the scratches, we set it up and realized the camera did not focus at all so I also gave this phone back and received a refund no issue.-4th Phone-  iPhone 12 mini (Ordered EXCELLENT condition )Received mid JanuarySeller: PDI MobileThis phone did actually look really good in the outside barely any scratches. I was very happy with the look. But after setting it up again, the camera could not focus so we contacted the seller and sent it back and they fix the camera then after a few weeks of using also, it has audio issues. We‚Äôre looking at social media videos suddenly that audio lowers  a lot. Since at this my 1st phone died suddenly we decided to give this 4th phone back. I don‚Äôt wanna take any chances since the quality of the phones is clearly not good. I don‚Äôt expect an issue with the refund. But I will update this review if I do.",

      "body": "The iPhone 12 mini, refurbished was visually in great condition. Purchased in September 2024. The touchscreen didn‚Äôt seem sensitive enough. I tried changing settings, but still bothersome, especially around the edges. After warranty was out, several issues began with the battery. The first month or so, it required charging twice a day, with or without excessive use. I liked the size so much and the fact text messaging was a breeze, I tolerated it. December 2024- Then the battery began getting really hot. The touchscreen stopped responding. I removed the cover and even took the screen protector off (I was panicking)! I forced it to power down. After powering up again, I ran it in low power mode, which seemed to help and kept the phone functional. January 2025 - The phone would say it wasn‚Äôt charged, plug in and it indicated 70 - 89% charged; unplug, 2 -3%. Phone gave a message: Battery not recognized. Look in explanation, the battery is not Apple and may be incompatible. Next day, thankfully, it upgrades. Since then, screen sensitivity is much better and the battery seems ok. It doesn‚Äôt need charging as often. I just really enjoy that text messages are sent and received so easily and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm carrying around a mammoth of a phone.  It also seems faster on the internet. Those are the reasons that I gave 2 stars. Also, it‚Äôs in a case and the screen has several cracks, from low level drops. This might be an Apple issue. The only other electronic device that I own that has cracked, is an iPad. No cracks on any of my android refurbished phones. In fact, I still have two around the house to use for shopping, internet searches, etc. This may just be the ‚Äúluck of the draw‚Äù and I just happened to get a lemon. I‚Äôm going to try to limp along until at least a year, just to not feel too bad about spending the money. But when I buy, it will DEFINITELY be Android!"

My phone had not been abused or subjected to moisture in any way shape or form, so 4 months of cellphone service for $240 feels suboptimal, when paying slightly more for a whole year of coverage would be much less so.I'm now tasked with \"repairing\" a phone i've owned for less than 4 months and now need to repair or replace at my expense.

      "body": "While I am completely satisfied with what I got, I was made anxious by the fact that there was little to no communication between me and the product stages. I was never told when it was processed, never received updates on location for the product and I paid two day shipping. While Amazon maintained the idea that it would be delivered on the 6th at 10pm, I was never told when it was even out for delivery! I was at college in the middle of class at 6:45pm when it was dropped off. I know and realize that they did complete the agreement of 2 day shipping but I ordered the phone at the end of February and they couldn‚Äôt process or ship it until the Friday BEFORE the deadline? Kinda ridiculous that I even paid two day at that point. I would ask for a refund but they fulfilled their contract with little time to spare, but it‚Äôs complete none the less.As for the phone: All in all, for a refurbished mini, I expected the battery life to be equal if not a little less than my current SE (2nd gen). I was right as it arrived with 86%. Not awful, what I‚Äôm used to. The phone works well and runs as smooth as I could have hoped. Set up between two iPhones is a breeze now and I highly recommend the direct transfer over the iCloud if you‚Äôre someone like me who has had Apple devices since 2011 (I don‚Äôt need to text my peers from high school or my ex boss‚Ä¶). The color purple was stunning and everything I wanted! No dings or dents in the body or on the screen. I have loved this phone since it came out as I have tiny hands and gripping this phone makes it feel like I have normal sized hands!To summarize: The phone is great, the processing and order fulfillment barely passed requirements with a lack of communication. For an expensive purchase, I expect to get updates as regularly as I do my weights I ordered.",

      "body": "I purchased the iPhone 12 Mini last year, and while I loved its compact size and overall performance, I have to say that the screen has been a major disappointment. Despite using a screen protector, the display broke easily, and I ended up having to replace it twice within just a few months.To add to the frustration, the fragility of the screen caused me to lose the Face ID feature. Ultimately, I decided to upgrade to either the iPhone 13 or 14 because I couldn't rely on the 12 Mini anymore.While the phone has some good qualities, the screen issues really overshadow them. I wouldn't recommend the iPhone 12 Mini to anyone looking for durability. There are definitely better options out there!"

I purchased a phone from amazon (amazon renewed) in May of 2024 to use for developing a new app. I did not (at that time) need to connect it to a cellular network, so I did not. On that front the phone is great: fully functional, great physical shape, and the settings showed that it was carrier unlocked, as expected.January of 2024, I'm at a point where it does need service, and after several days and efforts, I find that while it's unlocked, it only works on T-mobile's network. So not what I wanted, not what I was expecting, and not what I paid for.However, I should have checked half a year ago during the return window. It's a learning experience. When you get a renewed phone, make sure what you bought matches what you were sold."

      "body": "I ordered this phone because my old iPhone 8 finally decided to kick the bucket. It didn't die exactly but the battery started swelling. And then I found out it was at risk of blowing up in my face. Literally. Naturally I needed a new phone ASAP so I could transfer all the data from my old phone before it went off like a bomb. I didn't want to pay a ton of money for a new phone, I don't mind pre-owned stuff, and I like giving things a new life. So I got this.After the order being delayed several times my new (to me) iPhone finally arrived. I opened the package and was surprised to see that the phone was black; not red as it said it was. I was slightly taken aback but I was fine with a different color especially since I didn't want the hassle of returning it and ordering a new one. Not what was advertised but not a huge deal. I then began to transfer the data from old phone to new. When it was all set up and ready for use I opened the camera to see how much better it was then my iPhone 8's, only to see that it was as bad if not WORSE and it made a terrifying buzzing noise while trying to focus, which it couldn't. I was now certain I needed to return it, but just for funsies I decided to check the battery health. It was at 75% (below the guaranteed level) and said it needed servicing. I just returned the phone.This is more a review for the seller (Wireless Source) than it is for the general refurbished iPhone 12 mini as I know there are many different sellers selling the same product and quality varies quite a lot. I'd really like to give them the benefit of the doubt because it totally could have been just a fluke, but I won't ever feel confidant enough to order from that seller again.A word of advice. If you are buying a refurbished phone check the seller's rating over the past 12 months by clicking on 'Sold By: Whoever'. It could save you from a bad experience. I just ordered another refurbished iPhone 12 mini. I clicked on the seller before I hit proceed to check out and they had a 78% positive rating. Because of that I ended up getting one from a seller that had a 99% positive rating instead.TLDR: The phone was not how it was advertised, it was crappy, I returned it, I got another one from a better seller.",

On many pages it takes multiple swipes to find the sweet spot to exit the page, especially on pages that load extra content at the bottom, such as chat boxes, advertisements, etc. The email app is especially difficult to exit.The extra screen space gained by eliminating the lower bar for the home button is negated by the annoyance level of an unresponsive new feature.Also, cannot add a frequently used app, such as Safari to the main Settings screen.

      "body": "I recently purchased an iPhone 12 Mini, and I have a few thoughts to share based on my experience. First and foremost, it's important to note that my unit had a replacement screen. While the screen works fine, I can‚Äôt help but wonder if it impacts the phone's overall performance and longevity.One of the most common complaints I read in other reviews was about the battery life, and I have to agree. The battery doesn't last as long as I hoped. Even with moderate use, I find myself needing to charge it more frequently than my previous phones. For a device that promises portability and convenience, having to carry a charger around somewhat defeats the purpose.Additionally, I noticed that the phone had a few scratches on the body when I received it. While these are mostly cosmetic issues, they were disappointing to see on a relatively new device. It's something to keep in mind if you're considering purchasing a refurbished or pre-owned model.In summary, while the iPhone 12 Mini is compact and offers the usual Apple quality in terms of user experience, the battery life and the condition of the phone I received were letdowns. If battery longevity and pristine condition are important to you, you might want to consider other options or ensure you buy from a reputable source that guarantees the condition of the device. I ended up returning the phone.",

I messaged the sellers.¬† They offered to refund, replace, or give me a $15 credit so -I- could go get the batteries replaced.¬† Both phones had the problem so replacement didn't seem wise.¬† Refunding would leave me with my kids not having a phone until I got them replacements because I had already recycled their old ones.¬† Oh, and the battery replacement is $89 - EACH... to use the warranty it would cost me $39 (each) - on a week old phone... So I thought ask for the $39 and pay the difference out of pocket since insurance would laugh at me doing a claim with a WEEK OLD EXCELLENT CONDITION PHONE. They might even cancel my plan for fraud.¬† The seller said no, and reminded me I could simply return or replace them.¬† I could, but then my kids wouldn't have communications for an unknown amount of time and for their safety I found that unacceptable.¬† MAYBE the phone you get will be better - I got two with the same problem.¬† MAYBE you won't need to use the warranty - I wouldn't think you would have to even consider it the first week.... the phones LOOK pretty, no scratches or screen cracks or whatever - and when I called them on the whole battery thing they DID fulfill their requirements for Amazon A to Z - but sometimes doing only what is requirred isn't kosher / right given the situation... and I was stupid enough to recycle their old phones so quickly... just know that sometimes spending some extra money from a different seller might be worth it, because I will be spending $178 more.Oh, and I didn't take their $30 ($15 for each) - sometimes it isn't about the money, but the principle.",

This happens every single time I go to use the phone. No device should freeze and restart every time you try to use it.I won't even be running any programs on the phone, I'll just go to unlock it to do something and it happens.I'm going to probably submit a return and get a refund while I'm within the 30 days, since this product does not function despite being \"Excellent\" quality.

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2023",
      "body": "I recently purchased a phone and to say that I am utterly disappointed would be an understatement. The moment the return date expired, the battery of this phone mysteriously stopped working, rendering it completely useless. It's truly disheartening to experience such a malfunction after only a week of usage after return date has passed.The final blow came when the battery completely died and refused to charge, no matter what I tried. I attempted different charging cables, wall adapters, and even tried charging it from my laptop, but the phone remained lifeless.As a consumer, I expect reliability and quality from the products I purchase, especially when they come with positive reviews and reputable branding. However, this particular phone failed to meet even the most basic expectations. It not only failed in terms of performance but also fell short in terms of durability and longevity.Moreover, the timing of this battery failure seems highly suspicious. It is incredibly frustrating that the issue manifested itself just after the return date had passed. It raises questions about the quality control and the integrity of the product itself. I am left wondering if this was a deliberate ploy to ensure customers are left with defective products beyond the return window.I must emphasize my profound disappointment and advise potential buyers to exercise caution before purchasing this particular phone. While it may initially appear appealing and have decent features, the lack of reliability and the unpleasant customer experience I encountered cannot be ignored. I sincerely hope that others will be spared the frustration and inconvenience that I have endured.I have reached out to Amazon's customer service regarding this matter, hoping for a resolution. However, based on this experience, my trust in the brand has been significantly diminished. I will be considering alternative options in the future to avoid a repeat of this ordeal.In conclusion, my recent phone purchase has left me feeling disgusted and thoroughly dissatisfied. The untimely failure of the battery, just after the return date had expired, raises serious concerns about the product's quality and the overall experience provided. It is regrettable that what seemed like a promising investment turned into a waste of both time and money.",

However, the Battery Health max capacity was at 85%. Normally this should be fine, but with average use, I need to charge it 2 times a day. I've cleared out apps that were possibly running/draining in the background, but that only made a minimal impact. I've had the phone less than a week and now the Battery Health maximum capacity dropped to 84%, so I have no idea if this will survive without the need for a new battery. That's pretty disappointing considering I am switching from an iPhone Xs that should have a worse battery capacity and health yet stays charged with the same use all day.Everything else appears to be working just fine. Shipping was slow, but was stated in the order estimate. It arrived 1 day later than the 2-week delivery timeframe.I know this is the nature of ordering used, but was a disappointing experience.",

      "body": "I was hesitant to purchase a renewed iPhone, but I was not interested in purchasing a new iPhone with so many affordable devices available for reuse. I understood that with the purchase of a used device that there would be typical wear and tear associated with use and I was not expecting a pristine condition phone by any means.I purchased the ‚ÄúExcellent condition‚Äù option available for the product. This option provided several assurances: 1) The screen would be free of scratches. 2) the body would have no signs of cosmetic damage visible within 12 inches and 3) the battery would be fully functional and above 80% battery life.I did not receive that product. The screen had a substantial and tangible scratch across the lower half of the screen. I thought it was strange the iPhone came with a screen protector already installed, but I suspect this was placed to cover the deep scratch below. The camera plate around the rear camera lens was covered in visible scratches and dents around the bezel of lenses.Functionally, the phone was in good condition. The battery life is at 84%. There does not seem to be anything electronically or mechanically wrong with the device. The camera works great and there does not appear to be any internal problems with the iOS or processor.If I had received this product with purchase under ‚ÄúAcceptable condition‚Äù, then I imagine be happier with the purchase. I wanted to try to refund/replace the item, but I really could not afford to be without a phone through the refund process, so I decided to keep the device. However, I advise caution for those with high expectations looking to purchase this product in the future.",

So battery life wasn't great. The other issue was that the original glass on the screen seems to have been replaced at some point in the past. The surface of the screen wasn't flush with the body, sticking up above the sides of the phone. And the glass was low quality.

      "body": "I wish we had returned this phone within the time window. Within a month of getting it, the phone was powering off every 5 minutes. Our local repair shop found that the battery wasn't attached so they did that for us free of charge. Yay! 6 months later, it was doing the same thing. So we paid $70 to replace the battery. About 6 months later, the phone was not working again. $220 later, we had a new lightning connector assembly and another new battery. So this $320 phone has turned into a $610 phone. Plus a lot of time invested in dropping it off for various repairs."

      "body": "I should have read the reviews.  The mini's battery life is short.  But the biggest issue is that a few weeks after I bought it, the camera function freezes up, which I assume was the original issue.  Well, it's not fixed.  I did buy insurance but the problem is intermittent and I just don't have the time to deal with it!  It's always a gamble I suppose with refurbs but it's annoying."

The battery doesn't even last one day. I do like the phone, but will probably get a different one in a year or so. The company did send me a different color than I ordered, but since color doesn't make the phone, I kept it.",

Second phone was from Hybrid IT, listing states the renewed phone should have 80% or better battery, this one was at 77% and also stated it needed service because it wasn't working properly. The Third one was from Synergy, works perfect, the battery is at 85%. Finally got a working phone after a week and a half of trial and error. Amazon as usual has been great with returns."
