      "body": "Would be zero stars if able! Purchased this phone and within 3 months of use it just shut off and wouldn't turn back on. In doing research and seeing international version the internet will tell you that the difference is simply that you can use the phone internationally without needing to switch sim cards. That is true but also means that any warranty from Samsung is null and void. The phones are purchased cheaply out of Peru and sold as from an American company in Miami for more. When you call to see if there's anything they can do with the brick they've sold you their response is no. Nothing of monetary value and they won't do anything to help otherwise.",

      "body": "Would be zero stars if able! Purchased this phone and within 3 months of use it just shut off and wouldn't turn back on. In doing research and seeing international version the internet will tell you that the difference is simply that you can use the phone internationally without needing to switch sim cards. That is true but also means that any warranty from Samsung is null and void. The phones are purchased cheaply out of Peru and sold as from an American company in Miami for more. When you call to see if there's anything they can do with the brick they've sold you their response is no. Nothing of monetary value and they won't do anything to help otherwise.",

I had to return it and now get the 5G version.Apart from this, the phone is great for this price! I highly recommend the Samsung A15 for a basic phone.",

At the time I paid $179.99 for the phone chose the case that was recommended for the phone and the phone doesn’t even fit in the case. $249 waisted for nothing. Do not buy this phone it is not unlocked."
