Easy setup and functions well, It is charging as it should & with he fast charging port its really charging fast & good battery life. Appearance is nice, clean & slick.

She doesn‚Äôt like all the other phone chargers on Earth that charge every other make and model just fine.No, the Princess only likes HER wall charger. Luckily she doesn‚Äôt mind the USB that is integrated into a couple of outlets in our house. I haven‚Äôt asked her yet if she will tolerate my car charger.Seriously now, I plugged the phone into the the charger I have used for years and I got a message on the screen that it wasn‚Äôt good enough and charging would take 39 hours!! Yes. 3. 9. 39 hours. Bizarre. With two previous phones is was a few hours.So I will adapt to the special needs of The Princess and hope that I don‚Äôt need to start carrying with me, everywhere I go, her special charger.",

If you're reading this from the USA and thinking of ordering it or it's on the way, cancel it. The phone is great every other way but you won't be able to get a plan on it.",

The description claims that the phone is unlocked, but it is not. When I went to Metro, the representative looked up the IMEI and stated that the phone is locked and may have been refurbished. This is a big problem, because I need a phone right away, and all the local stores are out of stock for the Galaxy A15. I have requested a refund, but I have read other reviews that say it is taking longer than 30 days to process a refund for this same issue. I hope this will not be the case for me, because I feel that I should receive my refund as soon as they receive their product. I would like to be able to go to an actual store and purchase a phone without having to worry about this happening again. But the phone is very nice looking!",

They said this happened with another customer who actually had the salesperson go through the attempt and the she was unable to make phone calls or receive calls with it. So the fact that this is an \"unlocked phone\" is no guarantee it will work with all carriers. He also said it is somewhere halfway between 3G and 4G. Not quite as good as most 4G phones but not quite as slow as 3G. If this is all you want you can buy a cheaper phone for a lot less money IMO.",

      "body": "I got this to replace a 2-year-old Moto G power. The ratings and reviews said that the Samsung a15 had great battery life which is the single most important thing to me. I have been completely happy with this phone for a couple of weeks now. The screen is much brighter than most, which I like. I love many of the things Samsung has done with its software including adaptive screen brightness. It is a tremendous value. The only thing I'm not happy with is that when you use wired earbuds, the sound stutters at lower volumes unless it has a 3.5 mm plug with four sections instead of three. Earbuds with microphones have four sections. So I can't use my old earbuds, I ordered some new ones with microphones (and they work perfectly). Other than that, it is snappy, has plenty of RAM, plenty of storage, the fingerprint sensor works well, the cameras are pretty good and Samsung seems to be good about updates. Another of my essential criteria is no 5g. 5G is proven dangerous and I don't want to be anywhere near it. While this is 5G capable on certain networks, you can turn it off which is wonderful! You certainly can't go wrong for $170!",

The description claims that the phone is unlocked, but it is not. When I went to Metro, the representative looked up the IMEI and stated that the phone is locked and may have been refurbished. This is a big problem, because I need a phone right away, and all the local stores are out of stock for the Galaxy A15. I have requested a refund, but I have read other reviews that say it is taking longer than 30 days to process a refund for this same issue. I hope this will not be the case for me, because I feel that I should receive my refund as soon as they receive their product. I would like to be able to go to an actual store and purchase a phone without having to worry about this happening again. But the phone is very nice looking!",

So the fact that this is an \"unlocked phone\" is no guarantee it will work with all carriers. He also said it is somewhere halfway between 3G and 4G.

      "body": "Nowhere in the product description does it say this phone is not supported by U.S cellular companies. I bought it thinking I can use it for travel. After a week of long conversations with Verizon, it miraculously received service. Thinking that they now recognized this model, I formatted it with all my programs. 3 weeks later, it stopped receiving cell service. Days of trouble shooting later, Verizon contacted me with a notification they had shut service off after realizing it wasn't a U.S. Model -- 3 days AFTER Amazon's free return date. Luckily, after a few days of negotiation with Amazon, I was allowed to return it.",

Verizon tried many ways to figure out how to activate the phone and subsequently concluded that the phone was not compatible with Verizon. A paper that came with the phone gave instructions if the phone did not activate right away for different phone services. I followed the steps, and it still didn't work.
