      "body": "2024-06 update: years of subscription, mint roaming is awesome!It has been a couple years since I started my trial. I did acknowledge that T-Mobile is/has acquiring/acquired Mint, I do wish there is no further change to the existing plan, but increasing the data allowance would be awesome.I did travel to Canada and Germany this year, and I was able to roam in both countries by purchasing the mint roaming pass. This is rare for prepaid services I have to say.2022-07 update: hotspot also works under 5GHad to make some travels in the past month, I used the hotspot feature, and did a speed test. The hotspot speed tested on my laptop is the same as the one on the phone, which is 5G speed not capped at 4G/LTE or any lower speed. Gotta recommend this. Also I renewed again. Coverage still depends on T-Mobile.2021-12 update: eSIM is available!If you need help to convert to eSIM, navigate to the online portal and request it for free. Takes about 5 minutes.2020-10 update: T-Mobile turned on 5G in my area. I saw 5G on my Samsung Note 20, did a speed test, in the ball park of 200Mbps. Hence, when not congested,  performance is indeed rather nice. Latency is in mid 50 ms.2020 - 03 Update: I renewed for another 12 months. I don't see a reason to leave. Need more info? Scroll down!UPDATE:  IOS Wi-Fi calling worked. Please update your system to iOS11+.It has been 3 months, I renewed as annual plan. The past 3 months experiences were pleasant. If you need more details, keep scrolling down!I have been using different prepaid services for my personal phone since my business phone from the company handles most of my calls. Hence, I can risk my own device to try out all the possibilities and save a couple dollars.Hereby, let me break down into pros and cons:==============================================================================Pros:1. Big amount of data with hotspot tethering supported!Okay, for under $30 per month excluding the tax and fees, you can't find anything like this. If you purchase this on sale, yes, it will be 5GB (NOW WITH 8GB) per month for you for 3 months.2. Wi-Fi calling on Android actually works! (With supported phones)With Pixel XL and another T-Mobile Samsung phone, I was able to get Wi-Fi calling working, simply by registering online. Do make sure to check your phone compatibility. iPhone from my wife simply can't do it. Please bear that in mind. ( Worked with new iOS update! ) Make sure you update your E911 address on the website after the activation.3. Hassle free activation with no credit card needed for sign up!Well, if you are not sure if you will stick around with it, and worry about auto charge, during the sign up period, you can skip for adding credit card. And activation only requires the ACT CODE on the back of the card, takes about 1 minute to activate.4. Cute and elegant account management interface.My wife likes the sim card and the mascot design, you can't deny it. And the web management interface is WAYYYYYY better than some of those competitors. You can easily get the most you needed from it. But, how often do you need to log in anyway?5. Number good for banks and short-codesYes, your banks and short-code service will go through like a breeze.==================================================================================Now, lets talk about Cons:1. Data de-prioritizationThis thing is prepaid as well. So it is subject to throttling. That is generally known as de-prioritization. Since you are paying for the service with a discount. So you are not in the fast lane always.During the busy time in downtown Chicago, Seattle, and San Francisco, this card will speed lower.I saw some posts actually complain about the speed, but most of them didn't factor in this issue. The speed is not painfully slow unless you go to the stadium on a game day. I'd suggest on Game Day, just concentrate on the game and family rather than Instagram, makes you a gentleman. (Well, when you have to, since stuff won't load... Like 0.02 mbps for download...)But yes, off-busy time, I had same fast speed across boards as the speed from postpaid tmobile business plan.2. Customer serviceWell, the customer service waiting time over the phone is... long. So grab a cup of coffee when you call.3. Number poolWell, they must withdraw the number from a pool of prepaid, then depending on your luck. If the previous owner had the number signed up for some ghetto things, you will get spam calls and so.You folks might ask National Do Not Call List... Okay, here is a thing, it takes 30 days for the system to completely register your account.====================================================================================Overall, what do I think?I'll stick around for 3 months, at least. (I mean, I paid for this already, no refund at this point...) Also, if after 3 month, new customer if and only if gets the same $20 for 3 months, then yes.If it would be your primary phone and you need to do your next millionaire job with your service, then I guess no, go postpaid.If you are a person like me, who only uses data for none crazy things, like just social media, email, web browsing, or 9GAG on the go. You'd be fine. Streaming? Not so much...Good luck and have fun folks! Keep the SIM card, cuz it is cute!",

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2022",
      "body": "Got sick of paying Sprint (later T-Mobile) crazy monthly fees.  But wasn't excited about going through the conversion myself (without a store clerk/tech there to do it).  But I have to say, it wasn't bad at all!First, Mint is a T-Mobile sub-carrier, so I was reassured that I was not \"going far\" in my case.  (this doesn't really matter)Second, setting it up is easy.  You install the app on your phone and create an account.  You stick the chip into your phone.  You tell the app your chip number.  Hit a few more Next Next Next buttons, and boom, you're done.  The whole thing took about 5 minutes.I did 5 of these in one evening.  4 of them were done in 5 minutes.  1 of them took about 15-20 before the system picked that person up.  Not sure why, but who cares.  It works great for everyone, now.The price is fantastic.  Note that it's an introductory price.  It went up by about $5/month after the intro period was over.  But this is still WAY cheaper.Coverage is great... it's uses T-Mobile's network, so it's as good as their network is in your area.  Supposedly, as a sub-carrier, T-Mobile reserves the right to slow you down when things get congested, so their main customers can have priority.  If this has ever happened, I've never noticed.  I say, go for it.Bandwidth is 4 gb/month, which is fine for more users.  I use less than a gig per month because i'm always in wireless places.  The wife walks the dog on the trail and listens to podcasts & stuff, so she uses all of her 4 gb/month.  You can buy more, but it can get pricey, like $10 per extra gig.  If you don't buy it, your data use is slowed WAY down when you run out... technically it still works, but it will feel like the 56k modem days.  So decide if the 4 gb is enough for you.  There are 5 of us, and only 1 of us even comes close to using it all each month.The app isn't very detailed.  It's cute, modern, even a little edgy in style.  But it didn't NOT give you detail on your bandwidth.  It will tell you your total, and dates when it will replenish, but that's about it.  Probably good enough for 90% of the people out there.  I would like to know more about what apps or types of data I'm burning through, but I suppose you can get a lot of that off your phone if it's at all modern.I'm loving Mint, and highly recommend it.",

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2018",
      "body": "November 19, 2018 update - It's been one month today. Still couldn't be happier. I spent a week on vacation. No problem with service. Wireless internet went out for a couple hours while I was at the resort. I used my phone as a hotspot. It's been a really good experience. I thought my plan month was over tomorrow, so I had planned to run out my data tonight (I only used 2.7GB) by using my phone as a hotspot for my Roku (it eats about 2.3GB/hour) to see how fast the non-4G LTE data is. The phone plan includes unlimited data, you just pay for the 4G LTE data, after that you get slower data. How much slower is the question. That will have to wait until next month because I got a text earlier saying my second month had started. Stay tuned for the answer next month. Mint is great.October 22, 2018 - I was an AT&T customer for ~10 years @ $80/month (unlimited talk & text w/ 2GB/month). I could go into all the details of why I didn’t change before now, but I’ll save you the pain of reading that and me typing it. It’s going to be a long story anyway.I got an offer in the mail from Spectrum Mobile for unlimited talk & text with either unlimited data ($45/month) or pay for what you use ($15/GB). So, I looked at the phones they offered and didn’t like any of them. After a little research, I decided to buy a Moto G6 from Amazon. I got the phone, decided I liked it and then called Spectrum Mobile to send me a SIM card. Only to find out that they only support the phones they offer (I guess they’re more into the business of selling phones). OK, bummer.I then searched for cell phone plans in Amazon. Mint came up. I ordered the starter kit. It came two days later. I put in the first SIM and after a little easy-to-follow setup (I had to manually put in my APN information, but the directions were no problem at all), I was off and running. My house is in an AT&T dead zone (even though I live in Orlando FL). I had T-Mobile before and it was a dead zone too, so I thought that was my fate. Not so. As soon as I had the Mint card up and running, I placed a couple test calls from my house and was told I sounded perfect. Later, I noticed that my phone was saying it was using Wi-Fi calling. I'm not sure if this is a standard feature now, or just the G6, or part of Mint, but I know my old phone didn’t have it (one review that I read talked about having issues setting this up, I didn't it just magically appeared - I didn't even know it was an option). OK, I had to rerun the phone test. So, I turned off my Wi-Fi and did the test calls again. Same result, I sounded totally clear. I know it doesn’t sound like much, but before, I could hear people perfectly, but they couldn’t hear me half the time. MAJOR irritation. OK, on with my story. I then drove around and placed several calls from other areas that had been problem areas. Same result. I sounded perfect. I tried from inside a building where I was totally FUBAR before. No problems. So far so good.I tried out the mobile data. Sites loaded quickly and without any trouble. I decided to run a speed test. It got to about 35MB/s before I stopped it. In the time that I was running the test, it used 35MB of the 100MB on the test card, but I had the information I needed. Plenty of speed.So, the next morning, I got on the AT&T site and reset my phone account PIN (this was a little bit of a pain, but only because the AT&T website instructions were incomplete so I had to search for the reset link). You need this to take your phone number over. So, then I stuck in the second SIM card from the starter kit and followed the instructions. After reading all the legalese, I signed up and purchased the 3 months of 5GB/month plan (there were $3.41 tax and additional charges, so my total was $58.41 after the $5 back from the starter kit refund). This was about noon. At the end, it said it would take up to 48 hours to switch my old number over. My old cell SIM became inactive almost immediately. After a few minutes, my new phone rang to my old number when I called from a land line, but it was on Wi-Fi calling. It took a couple more hours for it to ring with my phone Wi-Fi off. It took a while longer for the mobile data to kick in, but by 6pm it was fully up and running. So far, so good. I played around with the app some. It is very intuitive and easy to use, so much better than the AT&T app that is just a continual struggle. It doesn’t look like it will be any problem to extend my service through the app when the time comes.Summary, Mint gets an A+ so far. Easy to setup and everything seems to work perfectly. If you’re looking for a phone, the Moto G6 also seems very nice. The screen’s not quite as wide as my old LG Optimus Pro (70mm vs. 73mm), but it’s taller (especially when you activate the Moto gestures to eliminate the wasted space associated with the Android on-screen navigation buttons). Battery life is excellent (my LG had replaceable batteries, which was cool, but the longer life of the Moto certainly compensates). Assuming the next 3 months go well, I’ll extend to the 1 year plan so I can keep the low monthly cost. I should have done this long ago. I hope this review was helpful (and not too long).",

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2024",
      "body": "I purchased this supposed cellular phone \"service\" for my grandson. He put the SIM card in the iPhone SE and then managed to lose the activation number. In an attempt to get the service activated, I have called their \"customer service help line\" only to find it is strictly automated AI with no real people to talk to, and it hangs up on me every time I input my zip code. I have been chatting with so-called \"live agents\" for nearly 3 hours now, and they have told me that I need to speak to Amazon about activating the phone. Then, they said they have no physical address wherein I might send a complaint to their CEO. Then, that they do not provide network services to my zip code area (<--- SHOULD BE NOTED IN ALL PUBLIC SALES MATERIAL!!!). Through Amazon, they have STOLEN MY HARD EARNED FEDERAL RESERVE NOTES (money), and they're making Amazon their scapegoat. I have screenshots of the entire \"conversation.\" Mint Mobile is an outright FRAUD company!!! I am going to go get new phone service through walmart/boost mobile, and am going to request a return/refund for the $45 spent on Mint Mobile GARBAGE. And if the phone is locked by Mint Mobile, and I am unable to activate service with a different carrier, I will be returning the entire order (phone, case, screen protectors and Mint Mobile card) for a full refund. I would strongly advise that Amazon cut all ties with Mint Mobile, as they are blaming Amazon for their own Incompetence and deceptive practices!!!",

      "body": "This is a no brainier for unlimited voice/text/internet over 3 months. Then you have to re-up for 6 months or a year to get this price. Notice I said internet and not data. While internet is data you won't be able to use your phone as a hotspot. While they advertise that as being included. I have yet to get it to work on a Galaxy S-21 Ultra 5G, or a TCL-40 XL 5G. In spite of the recommendations from Mint Mobile Text Support Reps. I'm sure this could be fixed by a technician at a physical store location, but where are they and who has time for that. Finally it's not like there aren't other options. Excluding that minor irritation the service has been awesome! No dropped calls, telemarketers, or excess throttling, mater of fact I haven't noticed any throttling the 3 months I have had Mint Mobile. Their application is more of an upsell platform than anything else. But there text tech support is responsive and tries their best to be helpful. So if you don't care about having a hot spot. Are willing to pay as you go quarterly at best, not monthly, Mint Mobile may be for you. Especially if you can pay by the year!",

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2020",
      "body": "General Overview-  Prior to using Mint mobile, I had been with AT&T for 10 years.  I have been using MINT mobile for 6 months now, and I have no complaints.  I purchased the 12gb/month at $25 per month.  Mint sent me a nice letter with the sim card inside that can break down from a regular sim, microsim, or nanosim.  Putting in the sim was as easy as taking a pin or paperclip, popping out the sim tray, and putting it in the phone. Of note, this $75 deal is for a 3 month package, and to maintain that rate, you must pay up front for a whole year.  Honestly, it is so nice knowing I do not have to pay another phone bill until November this year.Data plans- At the time of this posting, Mint offers 3gb, 8gb, and 12gb plans with prices of $15, $20, and $25 per month respectively.  When you buy in bulk, the more you save.  Many people I have talked to about Mint mobile are skeptical because they do not offer an unlimited data option at this time.  I do not think people realize how much data they actually use.  Mint plans all have unlimited talk and text in the US and after reviewing my monthly usage, I realized that even the 12gb plan I have is too much and when I renew I will be going to the 8gb plan.  Think about it, at home you are on wifi and at work you are on wifi.  Unlimited data is a scam given by big phone companies to make you pay for more than what you need.Call quality- I do not see a difference in call quality compared to my prior carrier.  I have only had one dropped call in 6 months of use.  Data speeds appear to be adequate for daily use, obviously in high traffic areas such as concerts, data speeds and accessibility are negatively impacted.Referrals- You are able to refer others to mint mobile using your referral code.  For example, my referral code is fbuyme/nBqV.  When someone signs up using your link, both you and the person you referred get a $15 credit towards your next renewal bill.  There was even a promotion once where if you refer 5 people you would get enough credit for 1-2 years of service depending on the plan you chose.  I have referred friends and family to Mint and they also enjoy the service and especially the price!Promotions-Occasionally, there are deals where you can get 6 months free when you sign up or the service for a discounted rate, so if you are thinking of making the switch, wait for a promotion.  From time to time, Mint opens an exclusive \"underground\" website, where users of mint can get exclusive clothing, gear, accessories, etc.Keep your own phone number -Moving my number from my prior carrier was seamless and extremely fast, when I input my number into the app my phone began working in minutes.  I believe I had to call my prior phone company first because I was on the plan with another user, but after that its as simple as downloading the mint mobile app and inputting your phone number.Compatibility- I have used Mint only with iphones, and it works seamlessly.  Mobile hot spot works. Visual voicemail works. Facetime quality is good. I do not have experience using mint on android devices, but there is a full compatibility checklist on Mint's website.  Pretty much is a phone is unlocked, it should work.  Mint works off the TMobile towers, so if your phone is Tmobile it should work too.  A word of caution for Verizon and sprint phone owners (except for iphone).  Verizon, Sprint, and US cellular phones use CDMA (a different signal) that does not require sim cards.  An unlocked iPhone is compatible and uses a SIM card tray so there are no issues.  I would imagine due to the lack of company exclusive phones like in the past, there should not be an issue as long as the phone is unlocked, but I would check the phone compatibility prior to making the switch.International-  when on Wifi, you can make calls and send texts as normal via wifi calling, regardless if you use an iphone or android.  International calls start at $0.06 per minute, and you load credit onto your account to maintain service out of the US.TLDR; Too Long, Didn't Read- Mint is a great phone company.  If it makes a difference to you, Ryan Reynolds is now technically the owner and also uses Mint mobile.. that's how much trust he has in the company.Check your phone compatibility and input your zip into Mints website to ensure the best results.  Use in the Chicagoland area has been great in my experience. I highly recommend Mint to everyone and will not switch to one of the big 4 until I live in a place where Mint doesn't work.",

      "title": "3.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Great Price, Terrible Service",
      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2018",
      "body": "If I could sum up the Mint Mobile experience in one concise phrase it would be that - great price, terrible service.Let me start with the good - and there are some good points.- The Mint Mobile Starter Kit is an awesome concept and more providers should offer something like it. I was surprised that a cellular service provider offered a sim pack for $5.00 that would give me a limited, one-time-purchase trial of the service. If you don't like it, you're out $5.00 - if you do like it and continue to purchase service, they credit it off of your first month. This concept alone is unique and is a great way to trial the service. I wholly recommend doing it.- The service plans are inexpensive. Truth be told, Mint has some of the most inexpensive plans I've seen. Sure, to get the most bang-for-your-buck you'll have to commit to a year at a time (after your introductory plan and pricing), but still - $25.00/mo for unlimited talk, text, and 10GB of data? That's nearly unheard of! Yes, you miss out on some features such as roaming or international calling and texting (outside of the US, Canada, and Mexico), but these can be added on if absolutely necessary and, if they're not major requirements to you, can easily be written off due to the cost.Now onto the bad, and there's a lot of it:- Support. Mint's customer/technical support is ABYSMAL. I guess they needed to cut costs somewhere, but I don't think I've ever experienced such a slow, useless support system. The first time I installed Mint I was noticing extremely low upload speeds (0.10mbps - 0.30mbps) compared to my Cricket service (~6mbps - 8mbps) whereas the download speed was roughly the same. I called the Mint support number to inquire about this. The first support representative put me on hold and then promptly hung up on me. The second representative passed it off on \"we're doing network maintenance\". So I decided I would go to the community forums to see if anyone else had an answer or was experiencing the same issue. When I went to sign in, however, I received an error. Low and behold, the community forums were down. This was on 9/24/2018. It is now 9/28/2018 and the community forums are STILL down! Furthermore, I sent an email on 9/24 to their support and did not receive a response until 9/27 - the response simply asked me to try signing in again and tell them if it worked. It didn't, so I responded to the email and have not yet received a response. It seems their tactic is to wait for three days, hope it fixes itself, and ask you to try again. Mint's support is by far the worst I've ever experienced so hope nothing breaks.- Spotty/slow service and/or deprioritization. As an MVNO, it's understandable that Mint would be deprioritized - especially as a T-Mobile MVNO as T-Mobile is known to heavily deprioritize MVNO users during peak hours. While this depends on your region, from the hours of 10:00am to around mid-night I would classify my LTE speeds as slow. Around 6 - 8mbps download and abysmal uploads of 0.20 - 0.30 (sometimes the test fails on the upload portion). After around 12:00am however my speeds will kick up to 22 - 24mbps down and up to 2 - 3mbps up. When not being deprioritized the speeds are pretty good (aside from upload), but during pretty much all hours of daylight the speeds are nothing special and data service is being deprioritized. For reference, I live in metro Phoenix.- The number assigned to me by Mint was apparently already on a bunch of scam/spam call lists. This isn't inherently Mint's fault, but it would be nice if they would allow me to generate a new number to avoid this - a feature that they, unfortunately, lack. So if you get a bad number when signing up for Mint, you're stuck with it unless you want to try manually requesting a new number (something I have yet to try as their support team is so bad and I really don't want to have to deal with them).- Setting up the service upon receiving a new SIM can be annoying due to some nuances. Sure, it's not extremely hard, but it can definitely be frustrating if you're new to the experience. The activation codes for the SIM cards that I received came with a random letter F at the end of them. Turns out that this wasn't actually a part of the activation code and I couldn't activate the SIM card until I found out that the F shouldn't be there. I was then advised during setup that I would receive an automated text explaining how to set up the APN. That text never came, so I had to manually look it up myself. In some instances, however, you may not even need to use your APN - your phone might automatically set up a T-Mobile one. This depends on your phone, however. As I am familiar with this process, these were minor annoyances and something I could easily work around, but for someone totally new to this experience, I could see it being a point of frustration and causing confusion.All in all, if you don't mind terrible support, broken things remaining broken for an indefinite period of time, and constantly deprioritized/slow data and you're only interested in the price point and unlimited talk/text, Mint definitely is not a bad option - its definitely one of the best price points I've seen. If you're looking for a seamless experience, good data speeds, and consistently working features, however, you may want to consider looking elsewhere.",

The process was fast and simple.So far, I have had  no issues with making and receiving calls, texting or while on my apps. If any problems arise during my 3 month deal, I will update this review. I recommend choosing Mint, but first check to verify that your phone is compatible with this network by visiting the MintMobile.com website.",

      "body": "Mint Mobile offered a Free 7 day trial period and I was having serious issues with my phone provider, it was a no-brainer to try it!I rarely use my phone, but I had a big problem with my previous provider in January after I paid for another month of service with them (over $16.00)! I'd previously made about 10 calls in about 2 weeks, all to businesses like Verizon, UPS, FedEx, Amazon, etc.. However, 2 days after adding a month to my phone I started receiving an outrageous amount of phone texts and calls. I blocked over 30 numbers and blocked over 15 text senders in less than 48 hours! When I contacted my previous provider they offered to change my phone number. Great! I thought, until I found out that they didn't bother transferring any of my old balances, or the amount of service I purchased several days prior, with the exception of my service end date. I dealt with over 20 agents and spent an additional $11.00 to have minutes to call my old phone provider. After about 2 weeks with No resolution from my old phone provider, I ordered a new phone and the Mint Mobile Free 7 day trial package. The new phone and Mint Mobile Offer arrived before I got any type of resolution from my previous provider!I was able to use the new unlocked phone with the Mint Mobile Sim card rather quickly upon receipt! Mint Mobile offered a new phone number for the trial period, which was ideal for me!I was finally able to get someone from my old service to finally adjust my old account after dealing with them for 20 days and over 20 of their Customer Service Representatives. They thought it was good for them to give me an adjusted balance, they did give me a larger Data balance, but they didn't bother with the fact I had no service for almost 3 weeks. They still expect me to renew my service with no compensation for paying extra money to contact them for their mistakes, no consideration that I went 3 weeks without their service. Great Customer Service?Meanwhile, my Mint Mobile trial period was ending. While I hadn't had a problem with Mint Mobile and their basic plan was actually better and slightly cheaper than what I had been paying, it seems to be the best choice for me!They offered to let me transfer my old phone number or I was able to keep the phone number they provided me during my trial period. Of course I kept the number that Mint Mobile provided, as I wanted No connection with my previous provider! But it was nice of them to give me that option!",

      "body": "Long story short: it works wellThis is my second attempt with a Mint Mobile SIM card in as many days. Yesterday I used the first SIM card in my Alcatel LinkZone WiFi hotspot and it worked. At first I was worried that I didn't follow the activation process correctly be cause I balked and backed out when their website asked for name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and credit card info. I needed time to decide if I wanted to give them all that info (yes, I'm a bit paranoid about privacy, etc.). Even though I backed out of the process, the SIM card was activated by Mint - no complaints. And yes, it worked well in my hotspot, no problems.The problems began when I tried to disable SIM operations in the hotspot configuration software. I needed the PIN. Mint, unlike many (all?) GSM service providers does not print the PIN nor PUK codes on the card the SIM came with, you must call Mint. I had called Mint earlier because I'd thought the SIM card wouldn't work until I completed the activation process. That's when I found out the card was activated. During that call I asked about the PIN and was told that it was the last four digits of the phone number. I wrote down the phone number they gave me and tested it by sending an SMS, it worked as expected.When I used the PIN to try to disable SIM operations in the hotspot configuation, it was rejected - eventually three times meaning that I now needed the PUK in order to reset a PIN. I called Mint and they gave me a PUK which didn't work either. After three (out of 10 possible) rejected attempts, I called Mint again looking for a way to make this work again. They said they were out of options and that I'd have to but another SIM card - $45. Or, maybe, buy a SIM with no service for $5. Neither sounded to me like a good option and I reminded the tech that I could (should) just return the SIM card for a refund.For me the best resolution would have been to fix things so I could continue to use the service from Mint but, by this point, I was pissed off and wanted my money back. I didn't look forward to trying to find a service that would do what I want at a good price.As I stared at the Amazon return page I saw that one of the options was to return/exchange the SIM for another one. That sounded good to me, I'd just remember not to do anything with PIN or PUK codes this time. I'd selected that option when I noticed that I could call Amazon to resolve the problem. Really?? Amazon has people available by phone??? And they know how to fix this problem????? The answer is yes, they have people available by phone and they can resolve the problem, just not in the way I'd understood. The Amazon person wasn't able to give me a PUK that would make everything OK but this person did get a replacement 3 month trial SIM on its way immediatly and sent me a return label for UPS.This is the next day, I have the new SIM activated (without giving out info, thanks Mint), installed and configured. It works well and I promise I won't do anything that involves PIN or PUK codes.",

      "body": "T-Mobile - I had already been a T-Mobile prepaid customer on their 3GB $40 a month plus tax plan, but as I work from home most days anymore I began tracking my data usage for a few months and noticed at most I was hitting 1.2GB a month (typically below a gig the other months), nowhere near enough for me to justify continuing to pay for the plan, especially since after taxes my bill was $44.50.MINT - I came across Mint Mobile's ultra cheap plans and did some research before finally pulling the trigger on the trial SIM.  I waited until just over a week was left on my last month with T-Mobile and activated the Mint trial SIM.  When I activated I was on cell and not WiFi, which may have screwed up the app's activation as I was unable to get into my account in the app, though my trial service was working fine.  I used it a little bit, but since the trial gives you a trial-specific number I did not use it much.I completely switched to Mint the day before my T-Mobile plan ended and bought 3 months of service for 2GB/month at $45.  I followed their instructions to transfer my number and pay.  I received text confirmation of my successful number transfer and payment, but for some reason I was unable to send or receive text messages as I was receiving an error message telling me that blocking was enabled on my account.  I waited patiently for a couple of hours assuming my number transfer was still in process.  Eventually I tried to make a call that ended up routing me directly to customer support.  Customer support answered IMMEDIATELY without any wait time whatsoever.  It was an honest and pleasant surprise as I expected most of their support to be online only since it's such a cheap service.  The customer service rep confirmed that for some reason my transaction didn't properly go through.  He was able to push it through while I was on the call with him.  As a technical person I was also able to confirm the desired APN settings in Android while on the line.  I was able to send and receive texts immediately and have not had an issue since - I have been using the service for two weeks now.Additionally, I was able to enable WiFi calling and texting through the mobile app.  I have been able to use WiFi calling and texting without an issue, something that for some reason never worked properly on my T-Mobile account.  Admittedly, I may have missed enabling the setting on my account or T-Mobile could have blocked it for prepaid users (I am unsure which was the case, likely could have been me not enabling the setting).I have had no issues with Mint Mobile thus far.  I was continue to monitor my service through these 3 months as I will be traveling to the Jersey beach and Chicago on separate occasions, along with a couple other random areas.  These should be good ways to measure service quality as I had not really gotten issues with T-Mobile in the past (aside from Chicago as I have not been there in the past).  I am also keeping in mind that should any issues arise I can always switch my APN settings to leverage the prior fast.T-Mobile APN settings I used in the past.Thus far I would recommend this to anyone who does not need a lot of data who also does not travel to rural areas much as I know T-Mobile's coverage is hit or miss in those places once you deviate away from major highways (but even then coverage in my experience is highly subjective to the area, many are fine but on occasion random ones will be abysmal).  Also, with the rollout of 600mhz underway for T-Mobile their network should be able to compete directly with VZW within the next couple of years.",

      "body": "(UPDATE: I liked this 3 months SIM so much that I purchased a 6 month SIM direct from Mint. I didn't need to use it right away so I just stuck it in a drawer. A month later I got an email from Mint warning me that if I didn't activate the SIM within 45 days from purchase, it would be permanently deactivated! There was nothing on their website mentioning this. I contacted their support and was told that this policy comes from T-Mobile (Mint uses their network) and actually the SIM might still activate after 45 days. But if it didn’t, I could contact Mint support and they would get it working - though it could take 5-7 business days. This definitely is something that they should make clear in their product info. I’m also not sure about blaming it on T-Mobile since I know that US Mobile - which also uses the T-Mo network - has SIM cards that last 2 years before needing to be activated. The rest of this review is about the 3 month card I purchased from Amazon, before I got the 6 month card.)Overall I’m really happy with Mint so far. It was easy to set up, the service works well, and support is good too.Activating the card was seamless, the info provided with the SIM and on their website was really well organized and clear and the process was easy. You can choose to add a credit card for auto-renew when the 3 months are up, but I skipped that. About the minor negative I noticed during activation is that I didn’t get to choose my new number from a list; instead they just assigned me one. Once activation was finished the website clearly told me how to update my phone’s data settings (though I found that on my phone, the first few steps were a bit different though it wasn’t hard to figure out).Mint uses T-Mobile’s network so signal strength and call quality and data speed are all fine on my Moto E4 phone. Voicemail and international texting is included (I tried both). International calling is available too, but only if you first add credit to your account - however even though I never added any credit, I could still make International calls (at least short ones - I haven’t tried more than that). Voice and texts are unlimited and so is data, though after you’ve used 2GB data, it’s supposed to slow down (a lot) until the start of the next monthly cycle. But as with the international calling glitch, I found that even once I had used up my 2GB (which I confirmed by checking my account on their website), my LTE data speed was not noticeably any slower than before.Since I was concerned that allowing me to make International calls without me paying in advance could come back to bite me later, I contacted their support via email. I got a reply within a few hours assuring me that they would investigate and I wouldn’t be charged. Similarly when I noticed that data wasn’t slowing down after 2GB was used up, I sent another email, the equally quick reply told me they would look into that too. Since neither of these are really problems (who doesn’t want free int’l calling or free unlimited high speed data?), it doesn’t bother me that both issues seem to still be happening a week later - but it is a bit concerning that if they give away stuff they’re supposed to be charging for, that might not bode well for their long term business success!P.S. If you get this card for a friend/family member and activate it for them, the good news is that although during activation you need to provide an email and a name and password, later on the only info needed to log in is the phone number and password (and once logged in you can change any of that other info including the password).Also P.S. The number I got must have been recycled. Every few days I get a robocall from the same company asking me to call back about an overdue payment.",

      "body": "I honestly hadn't given T-Mobile's network a shot since 2002 when I bought my Nokia 3650. It wasn't great back then...not was it years before when it was Voicestream. I have been with Verizon since 2003 and hadn't ever looked back regardless of my bills skyrocketing with grandfathered unlimited data and hotspot ($50/mo per line for data, $30 for hotspot, $70 for 1400 shared minutes, $30 for unlimited family texting plus $9.99 for each line to access the minutes and texting). My bills were north of $375/mo every month by the time I added one phone installment of $25/mo and insurance. I paid this for a LONG time knowing that if I changed plans I wouldn't be able to get my unlimited data and hotspot back. For 8+ years of this time I worked for AT&T and their terrible network and lack of unlimited plans never once lured me away from Big Red...even though I would have gotten half off as an employee.Regardless...my needs changed, I'm not travelling as much as I figured there was no point in paying that high bill when I used an average of 4gb of data per month now. In an ironic twist I moved somewhere with no Verizon signal on my property and only AT&T worked there. But I still couldn't get signal inside with team Blue...only if I went outdoors. I found out that their features such as WiFi calling only work with AT&T branded devices but I have been a Nexus/Pixel guy for years and wasn't about to change to an (in my opinion) inferior Samsung or Apple device just to use wifi calling.So I did my research, found that T-Mobile had poured a lot of money into low band spectrum that penetrates buildings better and travels further. So I looked into MVNOs like Mint and found MANY options, but the best for the price was Mint. I ordered a sim card to test out the service...and everything worked perfectly on my Pixel 2 XL. Wifi calling, visual voicemail with transcription, RCS messaging, etc. Granted, they still had no signal on my property so I instead put up a high gain omnidirectional WiFi access point on a pole outside my house and it covered all 3 acres without a hitch.So now I'm paying $35/mo for 8GB of data with unlimited talk and text that works in 95% of the places my Verizon worked at. PLUS I'm able to use all of the features of my phone that AT&T wouldn't support simply because they want to trap everyone into a 24-30 month installment plan on a new phone.Remember when we used to pay $200 for a top of the line phone with a 2 year contract and our cell bills were lower too? Well, I do. Carriers would subsidize the price and we would agree to pay for a while. Now we all pay $1000 for the phone and somehow our bills are astronomically higher than they used to be despite the fact that we talk less, text more, and use data most. They were more than happy to give me an 'aircard' with unlimited data back in 2009, but somehow it's not possible now in 2019 with more efficient networks and MUCH more spectrum than they've ever had access to? Gotta love that capitalism.Anyway, if you haven't given the magenta network a try in a while, try it again. It's made major strides. It's also the only network in the US that doesn't restrict features simply because you brought your own device. Maybe if enough of us make the switch to these smaller MVNOs the big MNOs will take notice and start treating customers better.",

      "body": "I'm honestly blown away thus far with Mint. I've been a Verizon/AT&T subscriber my entire adult life. For the past 5 years I've been paying $120/mo for service for my wife and I. Why I haven't jumped on this bandwagon sooner is beyond me, but thus far, I couldn't be happier.AT&T has been a nightmare forever. My house is basically a dead zone for some reason, even though I'm practically downtown in a major metropolitan city. I can't make calls, send/receive texts, or use LTE from my house. Luckily AT&T has WiFi calling, so I've made due. When I got my new unlocked phone, I realized AT&T doesn't allow WiFi calling unless it's carrier locked to them... great. This is when I pulled the trigger on Mint.Came across Mint by happenstance... looked into it briefly and immediately thought \"no way. scam.\" etc. After doing a bit of research, going through some reviews, and finding this start kit, I figured what did I have to lose? Reading that they refund the $5 if you sign up for a plan sealed the deal. Ordered the kit, got in next-day (thanks Amazon), stuck the SIM in my dual SIM OP7P... wow. Almost full service at my house!? I can make phone calls!? Magical.In any case, the entire process has been incredibly simple. I read some bad reviews where people had issues with the app or transferring their number over. Not the case for me. The trial was super easy to setup (barring the custom Android settings you need to create for the APN stuff... having a tech background helps, but they offer step-by-step directions anyone should be able to follow). In those 7 days of testing I regularly had better service EVERYWHERE than on AT&T. Faster LTE, better call reception... everything. I was shocked.When my trial ended, I pulled up the app and saw they just kicked off a new promo to buy 3 months of their 8G plan for $60 and get 3 months of the same plan for free.... 6 months of service for $60... I pay $60 for 1 month of service for myself right now. It's insane. So I made the switch yesterday. Transferring my number from AT&T to Mint literally took 5 minutes (have your carrier account number and online password/PIN ready). Upon activating my new account, I was playing around in the app and saw they offer WiFi calling and texting... amazing.I already purchased another 6 months for my wife and the SIM is in the mail. Once I get it, I'll be unlocking her AT&T iPhone and getting her on Mint asap. I can then finally cancel AT&T and be done with their insanely overpriced and subpar service for good. Over the next 6 months I'm literally going to save $600. That's the new phone I just purchased... paid for. Seriously? Even if the service ends up being mediocre (which honestly, unless it just stops working entirely it'll still likely be better than AT&T), that's a crazy amount of money to save.I'll update this review in a month or two if the service ends up sucking or I run into any other game breaking issues. For now though... I haven't been happier with a purchase decision I've made in a loooong time. Holy crap.",

Make sure you check on their website that your phone is compatible (input the make/model phone you have) and also put your zip code in to check how good the service is around your area! I did both of those things and I’ve had no problems with the service so far. I bought the unlimited plan first, then did the 15$ plan because I wasn’t using as much data as I thought I would (your data will NOT roll over to the next month if you don’t use it) The set up is super easy, using your online account you can check how much data your using each month, pay your bill, they will send you notifications when your plan is close to being up. However, it is not 100% perfect, as some of the reviews have said.. there are some drawbacks (have to buy 3 months at a time, bill will increase after first 3 months, etc) that may or may not be a big deal for some people, so make sure you do your research on the website/read reviews.They do offer a 7 day trial to try out their service.Customer Service- Ive had a good experience with their customer service. Feb 17th, I ordered a phone card through Amazon. I placed the order at 3am and it was on my doorstep by 7pm that same day. I opened the brand new  envelope and installed the SIM card, when I tried activating it it said “Your SIM card looks expired, you only have 45 days to activate it.”That’s not possible I just bought it through mint mobile on Amazon. So I reached out through mints online chat with an agent, at first he did say “you only have 45 days to use it, its coming back expired I’m sorry.” When I told him I just bought it that day he was definitely surprised, but after sending confirmation he was so awesome! and helped set up everything for me.",

The network speed is as good as my current carrier. So, no complaint here.The problem happens when I try to activate a 3-month plan by porting my old phone number over. Due to the unclear instructions in the starter kit, I end up getting two new assigned phone numbers with the two SIM cards included in the starter kit. This means, I don't have SIM card left for porting my old number over. There goes my 5 dollars.I need to purchase another starter kit to start over the whole process again.I am happy with the low monthly fee, the network coverage and the network speed. But I am taking one point out due to the unclear instructions in the starter kit.**** 6/30/2018 Update *****I order another starter kit. With my previous failure experience, this time I am able to sign up the 3-month plan using one of the SIM cards from the starter kit. So I still have another SIM card left for my other family members to use. The SIM card comes with the Starter kit can only be used to sign up the plan using Mint Mobile's apps from cell phone directly. The SIM card can't be used to sign up the plan through mint's website. The apps automatically deducted $5 to cover the cost of Starter kit.I am porting my cell phone number over to Mint. Just need to provide my previous cell plan's account number and password (of course, also the cell phone number to be ported) directly through the mint apps. In about 2 hours, I got a text message notifying me that the phone number has been ported over. That's fast, no complain here.Once the account is setup through the apps on the cell phone, then I am able to check my account status using normal web browser also (run on desktop computer).All in all, except the initial glitch that I was not able to sign up the plan with my first starter kit, I don't have any other issue to complain about. Will come back to update the coverage and speed experience when the 3-month trial period comes to end."

      "body": "Just putting this out there for those who are interested.Trying to solve my AT+T prepaid reception issues I became interested in Mint. Figured I could spend $1.00 to try it. The Mint website says my phone is not compatible with Mint (unlocked Sony International Xperia - 2018 model). I had a hunch this was not correct, so I went ahead and got the sim card.Tried the test sim card first. Everything worked - text, phone calls, data. After a day of using the test sim I decided to to switch to Mint. I attempted to activate online by myself and it would not let me. App said I needed to call customer service.Called next day in am, got right through. A very nice woman walked me through setting up and porting number via the app. The number ported through almost instantly - so fast that I was still on the phone call with Mint and was cut off of my call by AT+T! No messing around on AT+T's end! I finished the final steps myself.The only hiccup was that when I was inputting my credit card number, the app said it was not valid and the Mint rep had me enter it again. Mint ended up double charging me. So that was not good. Called back and told them to remove second charge. We will see how long that takes.Make sure you have your actual account number and pin number of your old carrier. This is important! Call your carrier and get this information! Other than that, the phone appears to work fine. I'll see how reception is and if it's better than AT+T. Even if it's the about the same quality, which it is so far, I have cut my bill in half. Hope this helps.Update: 4 days after signing up, my service was cut off. I had to get on chat and pay for my service again to have it reactivated. So I have now been charged $159.20 FOUR TIMES and I awaiting refund of THREE of the charges. AMEX is now involved. Sloppy billing, but I still like the service. Hopefully, this is resolved in the next week. Kind of disheartening.Update: refunds received from Mint. 6 days later.Update: using service for 2 months, very happy. Many of my calls are in \"HD\" (via wifi calling), so quality of calls has improved. Purchased a new Pixel 4a, inserted the sim and everything worked perfect. I am loving the savings. I am going to renew for 1 year.",

      "body": "These prepaid / pay-as-you-go cards are sometimes a pain. I used to work for an MVNO partner. At least when activating this it worked just fine w/o having to call support or talking to someone or trying a bunch of times.Here are the steps so you know what's what:1> download app store app. This requires a wifi connection (since you don't have mobile data yet) and gmail account (for Android). Probably similarly need to create an Apple account for iOS devices.2> open app, type in activation code that came w/ sim, and and verify phone compatibility. This is normally where stuff can go wrong. Luckily it worked just fine albeit took about a minute or so. Probably a lot of behind the scenes orchestration going on w/ t-mobile's network, partner networks, database updates, allocating phone number, etc, etc.3> insert sim card4> last step is to manually  populate some rather technical phone settings and configurations for mobile data. Seems like this stuff should be automatically handled via the app but it's likely the app - no app - has the required access to modify these phone settings so I guess it is what it is.Like I said all worked fine. I can imagine some people use phones that aren't 100% compatible or maybe aren't unlocked or maybe even it's too technical for some people. It'd be great if you could just insert SIM and be done but I guess that might not be secure. The key seems to be the activation code. Not entirely sure why this is necessary but probably necessary to eliminate SIM card forgery. I guess that makes sense.Would buy again.",

      "body": "Quick Background:  I saw the Super Bowl Commercial and jumped on the $20 promo deal that was running during the time for my first line with Mint. Since everything went pretty smoothly, I went and purchased another line and ported my personal line over to Mint. I'll break down a few things:Activation + Porting Process:The entire activation process was very seamless and I really appreciated that fact that you didn't have to provide a credit card or setup AutoPay especially if you just want to try out the service. One of the main things that was holding me back from porting into Mint was the mixed feedback from Mint's community forum and Reddit regarding the porting in process. Didn't really look forward to the possibility of having zero service for an extended time. Thankfully, the porting process for me was very painless, it was completed in around 5 minutes! No issues with calls, data, or texts. *Disclaimer* You can only port your number during the activation process so you can't try porting your number after you activate the sim.Service:Personally haven't had any major issues with the service, I also live in a larger city so that probably helps. Mint runs on T-Mobile, so wherever T-Mobile has coverage you're solid. 4-months in and haven't ran into any issues with the service. Also, from what I can tell, data speeds from Mint were not capped which is neat to see.Domestic Roaming:While T-Mobile has ok domestic roaming piggybacking off AT&T and other regional GSM networks, Mint doesn't provide ANY form of domestic roaming. This means that if you can't get native T-Mobile coverage your phone is completely dead. This could be a dealbreaker for some especially if you travel often. I would definitely double-check Mint's coverage maps first just to make sure you're getting coverage where you live and commute.Mobile Hotspot:Was very surprised that hotspot tethering is included with every plan. I use this very often and it's pretty rare these days to see that.User Interface :The UI both the website and the app is very clean and easy to use. No issues here.Support:Haven't yet ran into a situation which needed me to contact their support yet but from what I can tell Mint's support isn't too bad. It also has a Community Forum and Reddit where you'll get a response to questions and problems pretty quickly.Taxes + Fees:There are taxes and fees, but hey, I think it's better than paying fees every single month.Overall Mint has been a very solid carrier, especially for someone like me who tries to save money without having to sacrifice too much. Will stick with Mint as long as the prices are fair and service doesn't go down.",

      "body": "Got this during mint mobile's promotion for buying a.3, 6, or 12 month plan, and getting another 3, 6, or 12 months free. Was super easy to install, just followed 3 quick, easy steps, and stuck the sim card they sent me into the phone and it started working instantly. I didn't have to restart the phone or register anything, just started working.Checking my account with my plan details, it looked as if I didn't receive the additional 3 months free, so I called their customer service. Got someone who spoke English, with an American accent. Wait time for customer service was less than a min. (Have never had to wait more than a min. or 2 the very few times I have called). The gentleman was very friendly and professional in his speech. It turned out that because I got my sim card through Amazon it did not qualify for their promotional offer. I told him I didn't realize that, and he quickly said to hold on a minute. Got right back on the phone and said, \" look, you didn't know you had to get the plan through our website, and we want you to be happy with your new service with us, so I'm going to go ahead and give you the 3 months free.\" He also spoke like a regular person that wasn't reading off a script.Reception has been about the same as other phone service providers, but for the price and the amazing customer service, I'm perfectly fine with that! Where I live, no provider seems to be super fast and completely clear, it's a remote area. When in town, however, it works excellent. Even in places I couldn't get service with other providersP.s.....If you have a newer phone (you can do a search on their website, or pull down a list to select from to see if your phone is on the list), you don't even have to order a new sim, they can register your IMEI and you can start your plan right away. So, so happy with this company!!!",

      "body": "The only difference between this plan and one direct from Tmobile is the priority.  In earlier days, cell towers were more congested as they didn't have the capacity they currently do.  With a lower priority SIM card, if you had loads of Tmobile people in one area, priority was given to native Tmobile customers (those who went to the store).  Now that capacity typically isn't a problem, you shouldn't have to worry about the lower priority.  I've had zero issues with my two Mint SIM cards thus far.This was my second mint card for my wife and it didnt' want to activate from the app.  I thought I might run into trouble but I phoned the toll free number on the card.  A \"person\" came right on the line and fixed the issue in just a few minutes.  Support was excellent.I've dealt with many SIM providers for over a decade in my work.",

      "body": "I ordered this kit to test compatibility with my phone and coverage in my rural area. The kit comes with two SIM cards. One card is preloaded with 100 MB, 100 texts, and 100 minutes. The data was barely enough for me to run a few speed tests and check a few websites. I wish they gave 200 MB or so.After the test card dried up I decided to install the second card, order service, and port my Verizon number over. Mint says all that can be done through an app you can download onto your phone. The app doesn't work as well as sitting in front of your computer and doing it on their website. Sometimes the app times out and claims there was an error activating service. Some screens are missing \"back\" buttons. Just use their website.Porting a number from Verizon proved difficult. Part of it was my fault, user error. On the other hand, I think Mint could have been more helpful. My Verizon account number is formatted \"123456789-00001\" on Verizon's website. It turns out I need to add a leading zero and remove the dash (i.e \"-\"). That makes my account number be \"01234567890001\". I lost a day resolving that error. Then I lost another day with the wrong \"Password/PIN\". I thought they wanted my password I use to log into Verizon. Turns out the \"Password/PIN\" is a four digit number I had to create (or once created?) through the website. I lost a day with that mix up. Then I lost more time over a weekend. Then I lost more time when the app said my Mint SIM card could not be validated. Switching to the website re-validated my MINT SIM and finally the number ported over.Mint's customer service is very polite and sincere in their personal effort to want to help ... but their internal screens don't offer much information that can be passed on to us. \"Sorry, didn't work\". \"Sorry, doesn't work on weekends.\" \"Sorry\". \"Sorry\". \"Sorry\". Google was my best friend and it found the information I needed on other carrier sites like US Republic, Boost Mobile, etc.Oh, and be aware of the limited hours the customer service department works. Don't count on being able to call them at 7pm when you come from work. Plan on calling them during your lunch break.Once I got service established then everything worked well enough. Using an app called Speedtest I got download speeds ranging from 1Mbit/sec to over 10 Mbit/sec. A lot depends on not only your location to a T-Mobile tower but the overall traffic load. If overall data traffic is light then you can get some super fast speeds. Otherwise you get bumped down the priority list and your data comes in slowly.80% to 90% of the time I am always on some sort of WiFi connection so I'm not a data power user. Overall the speed and quantity is fine.The one thing Mint has going for it is price. Prepaying for a year ahead of time results in super low prices that are really hard to beat. Just know what you are getting (or not). I'll stick with it for now.So, three stars. If they had the same online guides upfront that competitors have, if their C.S. department had extended hours, and if their app wasn't so poorly programmed then I would bump this to 4 stars if not 5 stars.",

Sigh anyways both trial cards wouldn't activate at the Honolulu Airport and the rental cards don't have GPS thank goodness for Google offline maps feature.I arrived at my hotel and then I was able to activate the card but again I had a hiccup as it wasn't a Zip Code for billing when I specifically advised prior that I am a Canadian resident anyways long story short about 10 mins later I received a txt saying the plan I chose was active.  I am using an unlocked Android 12 and had no issues in fact you do receive and e-mail or txt to advise you how to add the APN settingsI do want to say that once I did get this working it is pretty solid and will come in handy for cross border shopping.I just want to mention beside that hiccup the app was easy to use and the service was great even when I went back to the airport I seemed to have coverage if you need a different # with a different area code you can always use Google Voice.",

Hopefully, it will reset otherwise I'll have to look into a refund.. because it is supposed to be for 3 months and I'm not through the 1st month..  It still works to call and receive text but will not work as a hotspot which is what I got it for.. So if it works for 35 gigs each month I will be satisfied.. I will update next month..  for now 3 stars for not being truthful because I cannot even run the speed test because it was throttled so low it doesn't work..Pro's:Easy install..Get to pick your own number...Was fast while it worked..ConsIt was throttled so low, internet is unusable..No roaming capabilities that carries like Verizon has thus it sometimes has a weaker signal.. Otherwise it's very good..***EDIT*** 2/23/2023Unless I cannot count, it has been 30 days since I have activated and I am still on throttled (very slow) data which should have reset...  So, I must downgrade my 3 star rating to 1 star since I paid $90 to get 1 month's worth of data rather than 3 months... The phone still works but I got this for the data... I am still going to use the phone but it defeats my original purpose... It is not more cost effective than other plans as such... If things change soon, I'll come back and update... So much for good service!**Edit on 3/5/2023This is terrible solution for a hotspot.. I needed a preplacement for AT&T hotspot which I use on a Nighthawk but I will be forced to go back to them because AT&T is a much better deal for that.. I think it was 100GB for $50 and the 35GB offered with this for hotspot purpose (watching videos, downloads, and using streaming) is just not enough.. You can get more which I did and you pay an additional $20 which I used in 2 days.. It would be real costly to really on mind for streaming or downloading and after 35GB is up the speeds drop down to a trickle..  I'm still going to keep it and for a second phone but haven't really used it for that purpose.. Verizon has better adaptability while roaming so you have to be in a good location for Mint... I am rating it 2 stars at this time.. It is not 3 stars or 4 stars.. They were a bit deceptive about the unlimited..  If they change in the future to better than AT&T I will jump back into their camp  but sorry Mint this doesn't even come close to cutting it..  Oh and as per the previous issue it did reset for the monthly but it's only usable for 35 gigs as stated which is not much for busy people.. I practice real estate and need a lot of mobile data that isn't too costly.",

      "body": "If you have just ported your service over from Sprint / Boost / Virgin, there is a potential software issue which could result in you having to buy a new phone.Beware of any Samsung s10e, and likely other models as well, that have been “provisioned” by Sprint or any of it’s subsidiaries. Once it takes the software update that was “pushed out” near the end of 2021, it’s not going to be capable of VoLTE (voice over LTE). This protocol is very important for the proper operation of the phone on the T Mobile / Mint network. And here’s the kicker: The IMEI checker on Mint’s own web site, as well as many of the VoLTE checkers on the Google Play Store, will report that your phone is capable. Boost / Dish Network apparently removes the “switch” from the “Mobile Networks” property tag thru this update. So there is no way to enable VoLTE. This makes the phone “downshift” to 3G mode, which is going away.I am a retired systems engineer with over 25 years of experience in the computer field. And I just spent over 2 weeks troubleshooting this problem! The solution is to “flash” an earlier version of the operating system to the phone. (Much easier said than done!) When I did this, the phone worked properly until 3:00am the following morning when the phone again took an update to it’s Android operating system without my approval. So I had to “flash” the phone again. This time I used ADB (the Android debugging console) to permanently disable automatic updating.This is far beyond the skill level of the average user, and I’m not going to get involved in Boost / Dish Network’s decision to “brick” VoLTE on every Samsung device they ever sold. And the bad part, they could “brick” your phone with an update right after you’ve just renewed Mint Mobile for a year. At this point, you’re going to be stuck shelling out $$$ for a new phone!Mint is still a good service at a very reasonable price. But I had to drop my rating from 5 stars to 3 over this issue.",

      "body": "For $5 bucks, I was able to find out if Mint Mobile was for me. Living in a remote area of NM, I never know if a network is going to work as well as their coverage map states. I would have saved some money, and some headaches, if other services I tried offered something like this. I had tried AT&T a few years ago, their map said I had excellent coverage in my area, but, it wasn't so. After signing up and paying activation fees, etc, I found I couldn't make a call from inside my home. I literally had to walk to the street corner and stand next to the stop sign to get a signal. This is nothing against AT&T, I just couldn't get a signal where I lived. If they had a $5 starter pack like this, I would have known in a day that it wasn't for me, and only been out $5. For $5, you get a 3 in 1 sim card which virtually fits any GSM phone. And 250 minutes talk time, 250 texts, and some data. All good for 7 days. It was super easy to set up with the Mint Mobile App. And changes you have to make in your settings are extremely detailed, so following those instructions were not to bad. Customer service is available if you need help. I used it for the 7 days. It's a great cell service for $15/month. For a few bucks more you can get plans with more data, like all carriers. I found no difference between Mint Mobile and other carriers that cost 2-3x more. It's all a personal preference I guess. I personally don't need a big name carrier, as long as my calls go through, that's all I require. For $15/month you're not going to get Hulu or HBO included, or any other big incentive. But you will get unlimited talk and text, and 5gb data/month. You have to buy 3 months service at a time ($45) to get this price, but being that's what most people pay for 1 month, I think that's a decent deal. All in all, the $5 starter pack is a great idea, and if you decide to buy the plan you get a $5 credit towards your first bill, so it literally cost $0 if you decide to stay with them. Mint has been around for several years now and at these prices I think they'll be here to stay. If you're looking for good no frills phone service, its definitely worth checking out for $5.",

      "body": "1) I am a Prime member, if you are not your shipping will depend on which choice you choose during checkout.  I ordered one day and it was here the next.  I didn't have to drive to the strip mall, find a parking spot, or stand in line.  Life is good. Product was packaged correctly and arrived in \"new\" condition.  Pat on the back for packaging and shipping personnel.2) I had used the Mint website to check that my phone (Moto G6) was compatible with their service. I downloaded the and installed the Mint Mobile app.  I made sure I was on wi-fi and inserted the new sim.  I opened the app and followed the instructions to activate the sim card.  I had to change some settings in my phone and I found it easier to open their web site on my computer and pull up the settings rather than write them down or try to flip back and forth on my phone.3) Service at my house was great.  No issues at all.  The app is simple and easy to use.  Data speeds were as good or better than any service I have had here at my home.  I have had Nextel, Ntelos, U.S. Cellular, Verizon, AT&T and Sprint.  All had a good signal.4) I had never had T-Mobile before and wanted to see if it also would work at my house and area.  That's why I wanted to try Mint mobile.Final thoughts.  This review is for the Mint Mobile Starter Kit.  I stand by my 5 star rating for this kit but I did not choose to switch my mobile carrier and here's why.While the coverage was great at my house, just a few miles away I was unable to get a signal (central Virginia) and only spotty coverage on routes I travel most often.  When entering city limits coverage picked up considerably but still dropped a few calls.  When stationary, I had better results.  The plan I have now, while twice the cost, has unlimited data and dropped fewer calls so I'll stick with it for now.If you have a compatible phone, are looking to save some money,  and $5.00, I would recommend you give them a try using this starter kit. You only give them your name and email address and Zip code (for number assignment).  No credit card or billing information. Depending on where you live and travel you may have better coverage than I do and you could save hundreds of dollars.Whew, this is more than I've typed in 5 years!  Hope this helps anyone that's on the fence.",

While the description describes this method, I assumed that I would be able to call in and activate or do so over the internet, but was wrong. Since I'm running a 3rd party Android ROM with no Google services or Play store, I had no way to activate on the phone I intended to use their service on. However, tech support explained I could activate on *any* iOS or Android phone and then once activated put the SIM card into whichever phone I liked. So I borrowed an iPhone from a family member and followed this method.Service was very good in my area, and I found this plan fit my needs and at a price hard to beat! I also had no problem subsequently running this on my originally intended phone after activation. But when the trial was up I had problems continuing my service. I could not activate a 3 month plan from the app nor from the website. I contacted tech support, who were responsive and helpful. They continued my service at no charge while they worked on my problem. It took 4 phone calls (all brief and to the point, they assign you a case number so you don't have to explain the situation each time you call or a new person contacts you) and over a week before the situation was resolved. Which worked out perfectly because this was the week of Cyber Monday and Mint was running a special $20 for 3 months, so I extended my service for $15 for 3 months! Almost 1/3 of the price I was about to pay when the app failed me. Amazing deal!So it seemed to me they still have some kinks to work out in their software, but were responsive to my problems, and I couldn't be happier with the service for the price. A fantastic value! Thanks a bunch green fox!"

      "body": "I was tired of my prepaid phones raising rates, as the phone was locked to their network, I couldn't change, so decided to buy a cheap, unlocked Android phone. This sim card deal made it super easy to try Mint mobile, as it gets you connected and on the network for very cheap, and if you like it, you leave it in, and just keep paying. It has worked pretty good for me, and several years later, I'm still on Mint. There have been a few rate increases, but they have also increased data amount, too. I like to pay for 12 months at a time, and get the cheapest price possible. There have been no hiccups with payment or service. As far as reception is concerned, this could be a downfall for some. Around most cities of any size, I have reception, but when I travel out in the sticks, with very small towns, as I like to kayak in some remote places, or visit state parks, I will many times lose reception. I always start Google maps at home, and with maps loaded, I can get to my destination, but when time comes to go home, I may have to travel 5 miles to get reception again. Overall not too bad. I live in Indiana, and there is lots of nothing out here, but if you live in a well populated area, chances are, you will have reception. Either way, this sim card kit is a great way to find out with very little to lose.",

Call quality is ok, but guess it depends what area you’re in and what phone device you’re using.I’m going to pass on this next time.

      "body": "Not possible to change activation to transfer/ported number once new number has been assigned. You get one chance so do it right the first time around. My biggest gripe with MintSim is limited customer support and ability to make changes. For example, if you've activated your plan and have gotten a new number, there's no way to transfer old number. I'm going to guess the same goes for transfering old number, to get a new number on same sim card is not possible. To make any of these sort of changes, you'll need to close out your account and purchase new one.Inexpensive plan - I couldn't find anything less expensive for $15 and get 2GB per month. The $15-20 price range tends to get you 1GB per month with limited talk time or some sort of limitation of the day. After 3 months the price does go up to $23/month which is not great. After the initial 3 months, the only way (as of 9/4/2017) to stay on a $15/month payment would be to buy an annual plan which costs you $180 + tax.Pros- inexpensive plans for 2GB/ 5GB or 10GB per month.- website for managing your account is fairly simple and intuitive. It does spell out how much data you've used and how much is left at any given time.-Transfer old number is fairly quick. Mine occurred in less than 3hrs. Although the expected time should be 24hrs.Cons:- limited customer support- changes to plan such as changing from new number to transfer number is not possible. This is very inconvenient if you screw up and mistakenly go through the activate (new number process)- limited coverage. We've gone on road trips and noticed the mintsim cellphone had no service even though my other Verizon phone had 1 or 2 bars.",

      "body": "I have to say that these is worst service that I have ever had. It's not the signal that is the problem, I have a fantastic signal strength, the only problem is, that I have no internet. I knew that mint mobile used T-mobile service towers which was good because I have a T-mobile 4G LTE phone that's unlocked. The problem is, in Central Kentucky, T-mobile cellular technology is over 16 years old in this area.  I looked over T-mobile's coverage map and it states that it has 4G LTE service in this area with verified addresses showing. I went to each address to see if I could pick up a 4G or LTE signal and I did verify that there is no 4G or LTE in these area at all. I Scanned every tower and every cellular channel thinking that they were maybe transmitting on a none standard frequency but no, there is no 3G, no HSPA, no HSPA+, no 4G, and no LTE.  The only thing they have out here is 16 year old 2G edge and that is it. If they had 3G UMITS out here, it wouldn't be too bad but with 2G you can pretty much say that you don't have internet because you don't.  All you can do is talk, text and get emails. If you want to use the internet, expect it to be slower than a 14.4 modem with constant time outs.  When October gets here, I'm switching back to AT&T and or Verizon because I know I will be getting at least 3G or faster speeds so I can get some work done.  I switched from Straight Talk using AT&T to Mint Mobile because I was trying to boycott Walmart for their dishonest practices but I guess I will have to deal with them until I leave this area.Update  1-4-20I'm now using Cricket which uses AT&T Towers, and everywhere I go, I get LTE and please note that this is not a AT&T phone. It is an Unlocked T-Mobile branded Blackberry Z30. Unfortunately, having your phone stuck in LTE mode all the time runs your battery down very quickly. So I put the sim card in my old  Unlocked T-Mobile Blackberry Torch 9810 and it works flawlessly. The battery will last for 2 days without having to be charged every day and the internet speed is faster than 3G. It's in HSPA+ mode everywhere I go and it seems to be just a fast as LTE without the constant battery drain.Before I switch from Mint Mobile to Cricket. I had to contact Mint Mobile to get my account number and pin number. They asked me why I was leaving and I told them that I could not get 3G, 4G, or  LTE in this area . It didn't matter where I was in Central Kentucky, all I could get was 2G only -- The only place that I could get 4G was in Bardstown, Kentucky.. Would you believe that they tried to tell me my phone was outdated and I needed to purchase a new phone in order to receiver 4G in this area.  Of course I know what a lie is, and they were lying. The Blackberry 9810 and Z30 where released before there time, they were future phones that Blackberry had to release ahead of schedule because of the pressure from Apple and Android.  A lot of people don't understand why someone would want an old Blackberry phone. Well the answer is simple.. I don't care for features, I want rock solid security, that is my main priority because mine is used for business.",

Agreed it was their fault, and that they would push the problem up to their accounting department to resolve. Assured me the second charge would be reversed on my credit card.4. When my credit card statement came out, both charges were on the card, the second one had not been reversed. Went to the mintsim site and reviewed the transactions. There was a reversal, but for $0.00.5. Again called mintsim support. Again, the rep was helpful, courteous, and agreed that the reversal should have been for the full amount of 71.51. promised to push the error up to the accounting department, but it would take a few days to resolve.6. Two weeks later, again checked my credit card transactions. Again no reversal. Again logged on to the mintsim site. No further activity. The original reversal of $0.00 still is the last transaction appearing on the account.7. Calling again today to try once more resolving it.But have to say, unless prompt action to reverse the extra charge, where I once had planned to move all the family phones to mintsim, based on my experience over the last two months, moving to another carrier.Edit: With customer service, third time was the charm (finally). After a third service call, where again the service rep. was very courteous, the duplicate charge was finally reversed. The even did a follow up call to inform me the charge had been reversed, and to apologize.So, I would recommend this service. The price does go up after the initial three month service, but from 15.00/month to 19.00/month, still one of the best deals.",

      "body": "Update:Increasing rating from one to three stars because although this particular trial kit product didn't ever work for me last year (likely due to Amazon having a bad batch of cards at that time), I have since given them another chance.  I bought a 3-month prepaid Mint card from Best Buy when it was on sale, and that card activated just fine.  I was even able to activate it without entering credit card info, though it was a bit tricky.  I didn't port in a number so I don't know how well that part works, but the service itself worked fine and was a pretty good value.Original Review:I tried ordering this starter/trial kit from Amazon but the included SIM activation code came back as invalid, both on the app and on the Mint Mobile web site.  It could not even start the process of activation.I contacted Mint via phone, and although they did pick up the call very fast, they were pretty clueless and suggested I just contact Amazon to replace the bad SIM.  I dutifully requested a return/replacement through Amazon, and two days later, lo-and-behold, the activation code included with the new replacement SIM is invalid too.  It seems that Amazon's current stock of these cards (at least as of April 16th 2019) may all be bad.I contacted Mint again and the only other option they could offer was to return the second SIM kit to Amazon as well,  and then order a third starter kit directly from Mint (which, by the way, requires entering credit card info).I'd like to test out the service, but Amazon and Mint are making this very difficult to achieve, and if it's this hard to even get a working free trial, it doesn't bode well for what I might expect if I were to sign up as a paying customer.  I understand this is low-cost no-frills service, so that may explain why they can't simply re-authorize the SIM card Amazon sent me, like any normal carrier probably would, but it still doesn't seem like a good sign.I may still give it a try since this could just be the result of an Amazon mixup, but if it doesn't work this time, three strikes and they're out.",

You need to be careful to correctly change the system settings that the app shows you. Turns out I got better reception with Mint Mobile (via the T-Mobile network) than I did with my old service, and since I don't use much mobile data, the price is awesome. Your mileage may vary.Update: Mint was able to port my mobile # over very quickly, and everything worked fine EXCEPT my friends and family on the T-Mobile network (like Mint & Boost) continued to see the temporary Mint # when I sent them texts. Phone calls worked fine. Friends and family on Verizon, etc, didn't have this issue. I called Mint support (not too long a wait) and explained the whole situation. Rep had me try a few things but no dice, so she said she was kicking the issue up to their next level of support and they would contact me. Didn't hear from them after a couple of days, so called back, and Mint had no record of my initial call. VERY FRUSTRATING. From that point on, though, Mint support was quite helpful and ended up sending me a replacement SIM card which fixed the problem.So, I think Mint is best for people with a bit of technical savvy and who are used to dealing with, and are patient with, entry-level tech support folks. If you want the ability to stop by a neighborhood store and talk with a rep face-to-face should a problem arise, Mint is not for you. Myself, I'm quite pleased with Mint overall.",

That said, once I have exhausted my current, six-month plan with Mint, I will likely be transitioning to a larger carrier with more consistent coverage and a lot better group message compatibility.If Mint Mobile were to fix these somewhat small compatibility issues, I am pretty sure I'd be hooked for life.",

Very fast.  I had entered something wrong in the transfer form, so the first time I tried, the transfer did not happen - but I went back and corrected it, re-submitted, and it was done. Boom. New provider.Service has been great, I have noticed no difference at all. I got 10g data, and have used about a third of it so far, and no issues.I paid for 6 months. I see no reason to migrate off of Mint Mobile at this time, and hope to continue with them for a long time since they are so good and so reasonably priced.",

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2019",
      "body": "After trying several of the second tier providers, I settled on Mint Mobile for my spare phone primarily because they have an international roaming feature that allows you to use the phone to make and receive calls when you're outside of the USA.  In addition, they have an annual payment plan that saves a ton of money.On the down side (I removed 1/2 star for this), using the international roaming feature can easily cost twenty bucks a day but since I'm rarely out of the country for more than four days, the total up charge is no worse than inconvenience of having to go through the hassle of getting and installing another sim card once you get to the other country.  If you want to use the international roaming though, be sure to add funds to your wallet before you leave the USA because not doing so can be a bit of a hassle (trying to use your credit card while you're out of the country).  As for the other 1/2 star, Mint uses the TMobile tower system so once you leave the city, you don't get the greatest signal.  In all fairness though, I would remove 1/2 star from ANY carrier for that reason.Overall, I find Mint to be a top tier provider and their customer service is probably the best I've ever dealt with particularly because they were able to help me with a phone issue while I was outside of the USA.  The best part was that they were able to help me in English so that I didn't have to struggle with my broken Spanish (I really need to work on that).Thanks for reading!",

      "body": "Was in a free trail of Mint and decided to move forward with the service. So I purchased this plan on Amazon and was going to add it to my free trial and convert it into the Unlimited plan. Well you can’t do that without having to set up a new account with a new number. Changing a phone number is annoying, especially because so much of our lives it tied to using our phones to authenticate accounts we have and nobody loves updating everyone with their new number.I reached out to the Mint customer support 6 times and spent close to 10 hours on the phone or in chat with them trying to convert my plan over with this plan purchased on Amazon. They seemed annoyed to attempt to help me, offered zero solutions for my issue and then would tell me to do something and then later say that I couldn’t. Example of that was I was told to return my plan on the mint website and they would process the return so that I could process the in app purchase of the plan. I was then denied that return because I purchased it through Amazon.The reps leave poor notes on your account so you continue to have to explain your situation to every new person and I truly haven’t encountered a brand with less care about customer first solutions than Mint mobile in years. And I literally mean years, probably a decade.At the end of the day I had to change numbers again in order to use the plan which left a very bad taste in my mouth and honestly is really annoying. Mint is selling a product on Amazon that’s not compatible with what is purchased through them and it’s almost like they intentionally punish you and refuse any customer service help at all because of that. I yield caution to anyone making this purchase so that you don’t run into the same frustrating issue that I ran into. And there should be a clear warning on Amazon noting the lack of compatibility of this product with Mints app. Otherwise it’s misleading to consumers and doesn’t feel very customer centric at all.",

      "body": "I was on Cricket for a few years and liked it fine.  $30/mo taxes and fees included.  3GB data, unlimited talk text.  Cool.Saw Mint ad on Facebook so decided to give it a try, the same service but at only $15/mo PLUS TAX AND FEES, or a little less than $20/mo if buy the 1-yr plan.Ordered the SIM kit.  Activated it online and kept my number.  Went seamless smooth, took less than 5 minutes.  Easy.Service is great, just as good as Cricket, and the $10+ savings per month is nice too.  In fact, the savings is why I did it.Only complaint is there is no visual voicemail app.  The T-Mobile app won't work.  If you need one, you will have to go 3rd party unless your device has it built in.Two pieces of advice:1. Be sure to add the APN as described on the MINT web site.  T-Mobile pushes an APN onto your device when you activate but it won't work.  And be sure to power your device off and back on after adding the MINT APN.2.  If transferring your number, you will need your account number and PIN.  The instruction video with the SUPER ANNOYING fox says \"your passcode\".  This is incorrect.  You need your PIN, not your passcode or password.Bottom line:  As long as you're cool with prepaying, this is an excellent deal.  You can buy a plan with as much data as you need.  Unless you need someone to hold your hand while setting it up, it's easy.  Can't vouch for tech support.",

They give you a temporary number for the trial which made it easy to keep both phones operating at the same time. Verizon has really slowed down on service growth. If you want to save money and still have unlimited everything, give this a try. We pay $170+ for 2 phones on Verizon.. apple music and discovery+ are a part of that, but that's $15. We also have a military discount. Yes that's for 2 lines. Now we'll pay $40 a month per line. Give it a try. You can check your phone to see if it's compatible with mint on their website. If you're wanting to give it a try.. $1 for 7 days is completely worth it!",

      "body": "I decided to give Mint a try, despite other reviews. Everything went well for me.  Once the SIM is inserted into your phone, you activate the trial using their app and it walks you through.  I had two issues, both self inflicted that led me to work with customer support.  They weren’t stellar, but they did the job.  Coming from Sprint, they were much easier to deal with.Two things I discovered that others need to be aware of:#1: DO NOT LET YOUR TRIAL EXPIRE IF YOU ARE PORTING A NUMBER.  If you do, the second SIM will start the trial again and you will need a third SIM to port to.  (This was my first call to their support team)#2: If you are not going to do a trial, this kit is not the way to go.  If you plan on jumping head first, just get the regular Prepaid SIM.  They have a 7-day full refund policy, so that is the better way to go, foregoing the additional SIM.(My second call if you are curious was because I ported the wrong line).Time will tell, but we have good TMo coverage here in Denver and I used the trial to also test in San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland, SACRAMENTO, Boston and Providence.  There was not a significant difference in signal between Mint (TMo) and Sprint or VZW  in the areas in those markets I was in.A few service things to note:• being a prepay, Caller ID is “Wireless”. It cannot be changed; that is how prepay just is, all prepay providers have a generic caller ID.•MVNOs (which Mint is; using TMo network) are subject to more bandwidth management during network congestion.  This means since we are NOT TMo customers, when their network is congested we will be slowed and managed before their customers are.  Overall during my test, about half the time Mint was faster than my VZW phone, the other half significantly slower.  Since this isn’t a service designed for streaming (although we did in SD) and our use is email, social media, web surf, we are not overly impacted by this."

      "body": "My intention was to move from a 4 phone plan on metroPCS to something cheaper.  I did the usual Google search, and found Mint Mobile.  It sounded perfect, since they don't have everything bundled (i.e. 2, 3, 4 phones in order to get all phones with a single data package), but low rates for each individual phone.  I use some data, not a lot, but the other 2 use almost none, so I could get the $20 plan, and they could use the $15.  $50 total for the 3.  It's also on the same T-Mobile network that metroPCS uses.  I was dropping one phone, and just looking to get the 3 phones covered, so I ordered the trial to check it out...I got the 2 sim cards.  Put one in an old Samsung S5 (I wasn't about to use it in my real phone), and got all sorts of error messages.  It generated a new phone number for me, and would work for calls, but no LTE.  I called tech support, and they answered very quickly, and said that it was likely that the phone wasn't \"completely unlocked\" (?)  So, I moved the SIM to an iPhone 6... similar results.  I called tech support (again, they answered very quickly), and they said I'd used all 100 MB of LTE data on that SIM...  I hadn't downloaded anything!  It usually takes me about 2 to 3 days to download 100 MB via LTE, since I mostly use home Wi-Fi for downloads,  and I hadn't had this SIM card in for more than a few hours.Anyway, I was still willing to give them a trial with my real phone.  First I made sure it was completely unlocked.  I installed the second SIM card, and went through the process of activating the card following the instructions on the app.  When I tried to port my number, which is one I've had for literally 30 YEARS (so I don't want to lose it), it said that the SIM card had already been activated, so I couldn't port a old number to it...  Again I called tech support, and they answered promptly, and informed me that my SIM card could not be ported to my number, since a new number had already been generated.  They said I'd have to order a new SIM card.  They also said that I'd already used all my 100 MB of LTE data on my new card that had been in the phone for about an hour.  I asked if they would just send another SIM card, and I'd try it again.  They said I had to go buy a new trial packet on Amazon.  I said, \"Thank you, Good bye.\"The whole idea of paying low-cost up front works perfect for me, but these guys can't, at this point, deliver any sort of phone service to me.  Maybe it's a flawed app, a flawed system... who knows.  If you've got 10 - 20 hours of spare time to spend setting it up a new phone line, give it a try.  I tried, and gave up.  At least when you call Tech Support, in my case, they actually answered the phone...",

      "body": "So I got a new phone on purpose that was unlocked (Motorola One 5G Ace) so I could switch from the awful Tracfone to Mint Mobile. The switch was difficult, took almost a week to get it straightened out between Tracfone & Mint (each blaming the other, of course) and it's been a difficult transition from my Samsung Galaxy J7 to the Moto that I'm still attempting to get all the kinks out but then again, I'm not tech savvy when it comes to phones either (better with laptops, DVD & VCR players & TV's). Anyhoo, my 3 month trial is almost up so I looked at the plans now available, thinking I was going to be able to purchase 3 months at $15 a month for $45 total. WRONG!!!!!  In order to get the $15 a month, I have to pay for a YEAR up-front! That's $180 for only 4GB! 3 months at the 4GB is $75!!!! When I contacted Mint thru their Chat, I spoke with Leonardo (who couldn't spell to save his life making it a much longer convo than necessary as I was trying to figure out what he was attempting to say) and basically said everything that I already read (he included screenshots too). Told him I'm on disability so I'm on a very, very strict budget hence always having a prepaid cell  The only thing he suggested was to buy a new SIM Card so I could get the \"new customer\" price. Seriously?! Told him how upset I am with these prices and all he did was continually say \"you have to pay upfront for all packages\"... DUH! I knew that, nothing is for free! Told him he's loosing a customer and he said \"sorry\" and that was that.Now I'm having to either go back to the dreadful Tracfone or research the other services out there within the next 10 days before I loose my service entirely. Some of this is my fault cuz I should have researched Mint more but all the TV & online ads I saw/read implied (to me, at least) that I could buy 3 months for $45 total every time I had to renew my minutes (started with 10GB but easily could do with just 4GB). I could afford that but not their plans for existing customers. Typical bait & switch scheme. Totally ticked off! Plus their App & Customer Service aren't that great, no better than Tracfone and that's just sad. Expected so much more!!!The service itself has been \"spotty\" at best. Whether trying to make a call while inside a store or getting the store App to work while shopping definitely is not guaranteed. WTH 😫👎Oh and Leonardo suggested I \"refer a friend to join\" so I could get a discount that way. Like I said to him \"Don't think so! Not gonna ruin a friendship for a discount\"! Argh🤬",

All I had to do was setup my voicemail and I was done.  It really was so simple and quick, and I didn't have to talk to anybody.

I started out the trial for a day just to ensure my iPhone (asked old provider to unlock it but wasn't 100% sure if they actually did) would work, then the 3 month plan and then renewed for 12 months.$15 a month and the service is as good as the previous big post-paid provider. Home and work both have wifi. I do stream music in the car and use LTE outside of home and work. I checked my 12 month usage and was barely using 2-3 gb a month so the basic tier plan is good enough for me. If one month I need more, there is an option to quickly buy more. I make some international calls and many countries are 1 cent a minute which was cheaper than another third party calling card I was using before. Also, tethering/Personal Hotspot is included with no limit (well, up to your data cap) which was one of my requirements. I use hotspot very rarely on trips and don't appreciate being limited by a small percentage of my data allowance. This checked off everything I wanted. I have not noticed any data slowness yet.It could be if I go in the wilderness there may be not so great service or if I am at a crowded place, t-mobile customers may be getting priority but I can live with that for $15 a month. $1000+ a year is a lot to pay to have a little bit of more service. I have honestly seen the big providers also lag in building or remote places.In any case I am a happy customer for now. Moved my wife's line after mine. Hope they keep the service/cost like this and not get greedy as they get more customers.",

      "body": "I have been wanting to switch from traditional carrier services to a low cost prepaid service.  This one fits my needs.  It uses the t-Mobile network which was my traditional carrier so I lost no connectivity.  The install instructions are easy to follow and the 3 month, 6 month and Annual plans are easily affordable depending on your data usage of course.  They offer 3 levels of data so if you want to add more or reduce it for a 3 month period you have that flexibility.  My cost went from $1000 a year for mobile service to about $250 a year. That is a significant savings in my opinion.  But remember my savings may not be the same for you. It all depends on your current plan with traditional carrier  rates versus the current plan rates you choose with Mint Mobile.  Its low cost because you don't get sold new or refurbished devices like you do with traditional carriers.  This is all about your mobile experience with affordability and sensibility in mind.  If your smartphone breaks or the battery life gets fully depleted, you will have to buy another smartphone from Amazon or some other site like Apple.com or Samsung.com or the myriad of others you may prefer. Why should you be paying $30 to $50  more a month if you don't  upgrade your smartphone every time there is a newer version.  But if you are the person who has to have the latest technology and are willing to pay the traditional carrier costs or full price for the device then this service is not for you.  Summary, if you like your current smartphone and don't upgrade every year and want to save money on your monthly mobile phone bills, then check this service out.  NOTE: I am an actual Mint Mobile customer and I am not being paid for this review.  Its my honest feedback based on my personal experience and the research I did about Mint Mobile as a company.",

We got an unlocked LG phone for our grandson for Christmas and he was OK with limited data as long as he could use the phone with wireless, at home and hot spots, like one of hi friends (see my review of LG Stylo 4). T-Mobile had good coverage in our home area - Phoenix and grandson is happy with T-Mobile coverage in his home Denver. Mint setup and activation was painless - insert the SIM card (can't remember if we just used the adapter that came with Mint or if the phone had  one - physical size thing). Power up the phone and follow the instructions which came up and that with the Mint SIM card. I don't think it took more than 1/2 hour. You will have to setup a Mint account for billing, checking your usage, etc. We went with the special 3 month plan, $15/month for 2GB/month. So far after almost a month grandson happy with it. When 3 months end we'll probably go for the 1 year renewal of same plan, same $15/month if paid for a year in advance. This assumes plans and pricing don't change. The grandson has to send us $15/month - what a change :-), getting money from him. He's a Junior in High School and can afford to take on some of his own expenses - blessed with a good one. So after several weeks of looking at various plans for him, Mint came in at about the lowest price if paid for a year in advance and so far would recommend you check it out. Ask your friends or coworkers if they use T-Mobile and if reception is good - if so, go for it. Note, I've read that T-Mobile will throttle speed on Mint if their data traffic gets too heavy, but not an issue with our grandson since he will use wifi wherever he can. No experience with customer service, not needed, so no rating there. No monies paid for this endorsement but wold be willing accept some ;-).",

Unfortunately, no  luck yet!************** UPDATE ************I was finally able to get the SIM to work in my phone. I am giving it 4 stars for the service NOT their customer support. I found their level 1 support very poor. When I escalated the problem and was passed on to level 2 it was much better. I had to manually set up the APN information.The service itself works reasonably well especially when you consider the price. I had Verizon before and found that network gave my better LTE data in some fringe areas. I find the service acceptable and love the significant savings.One other note, I am using the SIM card with the MOTO G5 Plus and am able to get Wifi calling to work. You have to go to Mint Sim online, not the app on your phone, to activate the service. It took a while for this to take effect but now works fine.",

      "body": "Mint is possibly the cheapest phone service with unlimited talk and text plus 3GB of data per month [which is more than enough for me]. I love that I'm saving much money for my phone bill [even compared to Google Fi which I had previously]. I would definitely recommend Mint for the value.However, Mint's customer support is awful. I set up my new plan with Mint very easily. My Pixel 3 worked flawlessly, and I didn't have to configure anything. I called Mint customer support to ask them about the Android APN page on Mint's site. Background noise and a very thick accent caused me to have a hard time understanding the customer service agent. However, the agent was rude and didn't even answer my question. I simply asked what was the difference between using the APN on the website versus using what Mint already configures after activating the SIM card. The agent repeatedly said the \"site has instructions.\" I clarified my question about four times before I gave up because the agent clearly didn't understand my question [he didn't ask for clarification or offer to check resources on his side.] He also kept using horrible customer service phrases like \"as I said before\", \"as I mentioned previously\", \"like I told you\", and others. He also didn't ask how my experience was even though I was a new customer.In short, Mint is ideal for tech-savvy users like myself who will hardly need to contact customer service. However, Mint isn't ideal if someone isn't tech-savvy and needs to contact customer support.",

In order to save the most be prepared to pick a plan and pay in 6 month interval or if you want to save more and can do it, pay them in 12 month intervals! I’m really happy with them!

I bought a completely unlocked phone so I could try out different carriers if needed, and two days into my MintSIM trial everything works just fine, even the coverage is good in the Los Angeles area, this far I'm pretty pleased actually.However, like others have said, it's a bit too complicated activating the SIM card. The instructions aren't too clear and seem to assume all phones look the same in the settings area. Obviously(?) I never received the text message MintSIM was supposed to send so my settings would automatically be set up for me, so I had to get into the settings jungle and do it manually, which was a quite unnecessary pain.. It worked out well in the end though and I never even had to contact customer support (which is probably a very good thing as I've heard not so good things about their \"support\"). However, considering how difficult it was to just activate the SIM card and fix the settings, I wouldn't recommend trying to port your current number - if the first part was that difficult, imagine what a pain the second part would be.. But it's good for us who don't have a number or just want to \"start over\" with a new one. I'm happy this far, let's hope it lasts.",

      "body": "I have been a customer of AT&T since 1997. With a large family who is all heavy users using their service was costly. In hopes of saving money, we tried Cricket Wireless, which is owned by AT&T and uses their service. Unfortunately, the data on Cricket was extremely slow, and there were multiple instances where there were nationwide data outages due to the way Cricket routes their data (all data over Cricket is sent through proxies located throughout the Central United States). So we switched to T-Mobile which was a little more expensive than Cricket but has been nothing but phenomenal. Mint Mobile (formerly called Mint Sim) operates on the T-Mobile network, and I read excellent reviews of them on Reddit. I decided to try the trial SIM in my old phone, an iPhone 7 Plus and keep my active T-Mobile SIM on my iPhone X. The Mint SIM received the same exact service as my T-Mobile SIM. Mint utilizes the same towers and bands as T-Mobile, so you aren't losing out at all. I ran a few Speedtests (which was hard because the trial sim only has 100MB of data on it) and they also get the same exact speeds! Mint does not cap their speeds nor run the data through unnecessary servers or proxies. That being said, I will definitely be switching my family over to Mint SIM.The setup was extremely easy using their app and took a minute. Buying in bulk not only will save me money but is convenient in not worrying about why my bill fluctuates every month. You're not going to lose anything by switching from T-Mobile except the brick-and-mortar stores and the ability to finance phones on your bill. I don't finance my phones but if you wanted to Apple does free iPhone financing through Barclays or Citizens One, and AppleCare+ warranty is OPTIONAL! You can even finance Samsung phones on their website when you buy directly from them. You have nothing to lose! VoLTE works and Visual Voicemail is rolling out for iPhone and Android. Once Visual Voicemail is here I will port over.",

      "body": "This is probably the best way to start using Mint Mobile. If you read through their biggest issues you'll know that it's nice to have a trial period to get everything figured out with your new phone and test that calls, SMS, MMS, 3G, and 4Glte are all working as they should.Had to contact Customer service and play with settings to get everything working properly, even then there were issues. For me the network came in fine out of the box, 3-5 bars consistantly and LTE as well, however like many others I was unable to send or receive picture messages while wifi and data were both on and LTE was VERY slow, especially upload speeds (sometimes showing as 0.1mbps). Supposed solutions were turning off data roaming, turning off wifi-calling, adjusting APN settings, and trying a new messaging app. adjusting APN didnt fix my picture messaging issue as promised by customer service, but it DID boost my initially slow LTE speeds massively and switching to \"Pulse\" as a messaging app solved the rest if my problems. You'll have to find your own voicemail app as well and I highly recommend \"youmail\".All in all Mint is a solid choice, T-mobile's network isn't as good as verizon's was for me, but its on par with At&t in my area and significantly better than sprint. This was a great way to test the network and get my phone all set up without using my precious data.ALSO WORTH NOTING1. My phone number ported over from total wireless within like 2 minutes, on a saturday, which was awesome and unexpected.2. The packaging says you get 100mb of lte data, 100 texts, and 100 calls as a trial, I was actually given 250 of each, not 100.3. Customer service was actually pretty decent, I dont know how helpful they will be able to be for everybody given that there are no phones made intentionally for mint, but they try to help and they speak clearly. Coming from total wireless it was a warm welcome.",

      "body": "I have used several pre-paid carriers with my iPhones going back to the iPhone 3G and I am always on the lookout for a newer, better setup. Mint Mobile is currently the best I can find and this trial kit is great. You can try the service for up to a week without committing or changing your phone number and once you've decided that the coverage and/or speed is suitable, use the second included SIM to port your old number to the new service. Brilliant.In addition to MUCH faster speeds than I was getting with every other MVNO (AT&T, Verizon), Mint also includes free wifi hotspot functionality up to the full bandwidth of whatever plan you choose. The other day I clocked over 95Mbps down and 25Mbps up in downtown Ocala (Mint uses the T-Mobile network). That's almost as fast as my home Spectrum wifi on the downstream side and almost four times FASTER than my home wifi on the upstream side.The free iOS app makes it very easy to use the trial SIM and switch service to the secondary SIM. No calls to tech support needed! The app also tracks usage so you can see if you're getting close to your plan's allowed data limit.Like most pre-paid carriers, you can save money if you buy more months up front. As of this writing, a year of 5GB with unlimited calls and texts costs $240, or $20/month. I doubt you'll find cheaper anywhere and this includes the aforementioned wifi hotspot feature. When you buy a plan after purchasing this kit, the cost of the kit is deducted from the cost of your first plan purchase, making the trial kit free.Sadly, iPhones currently cannot use wifi phone calling when inside a structure that blocks the phone tower signal, but the company says they are working on adding that feature in the near future, so check with them before you buy if this is a priority for you.",

On 3/30/2019 I began porting my main cellular number from Red Pocket to Mint using a 3month 8GB/mo card I purchased for $20. On 3/31/2019 porting was not completed so I phoned Mint. RG suggested I phone Red Pocket to confirm correct account & PIN. Then Red Pocket gave me new/different account & PIN. Phoned Mint again and spoke to Brandy. Told Brandy that I had started MINT activation the day before with wrong Red Pocket info.Brandy stayed on the phone with me and got Lyn at Red Pocket on a 3way call. Due to problems from Red Pocket end, took almost 30 minutes but Brandy very patiently explained to Lyn what needed to be done. Less than 10 minutes after that 3way call, Mint Mobile was working perfectly on my smartphone.BOTTOM LINE: Despite the negative reviews and based on my 37 years linked to the phone industry, I've NEVER received better service than I did today from Brandy and RG at Mint Mobile.P.S. i expect Mint service to be same as what I experienced in 2018 with Ultra Mobile for about a year, meaning they both piggyback off Tmobile which great and just keeps getting better."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2018",
      "body": "If I could sum up the Mint Mobile experience in one concise phrase it would be that - great price, terrible service.Let me start with the good - and there are some good points.- The Mint Mobile Starter Kit is an awesome concept and more providers should offer something like it. I was surprised that a cellular service provider offered a sim pack for $5.00 that would give me a limited, one-time-purchase trial of the service. If you don't like it, you're out $5.00 - if you do like it and continue to purchase service, they credit it off of your first month. This concept alone is unique and is a great way to trial the service. I wholly recommend doing it.- The service plans are inexpensive. Truth be told, Mint has some of the most inexpensive plans I've seen. Sure, to get the most bang-for-your-buck you'll have to commit to a year at a time (after your introductory plan and pricing), but still - $25.00/mo for unlimited talk, text, and 10GB of data? That's nearly unheard of! Yes, you miss out on some features such as roaming or international calling and texting (outside of the US, Canada, and Mexico), but these can be added on if absolutely necessary and, if they're not major requirements to you, can easily be written off due to the cost.Now onto the bad, and there's a lot of it:- Support. Mint's customer/technical support is ABYSMAL. I guess they needed to cut costs somewhere, but I don't think I've ever experienced such a slow, useless support system. The first time I installed Mint I was noticing extremely low upload speeds (0.10mbps - 0.30mbps) compared to my Cricket service (~6mbps - 8mbps) whereas the download speed was roughly the same. I called the Mint support number to inquire about this. The first support representative put me on hold and then promptly hung up on me. The second representative passed it off on \"we're doing network maintenance\". So I decided I would go to the community forums to see if anyone else had an answer or was experiencing the same issue. When I went to sign in, however, I received an error. Low and behold, the community forums were down. This was on 9/24/2018. It is now 9/28/2018 and the community forums are STILL down! Furthermore, I sent an email on 9/24 to their support and did not receive a response until 9/27 - the response simply asked me to try signing in again and tell them if it worked. It didn't, so I responded to the email and have not yet received a response. It seems their tactic is to wait for three days, hope it fixes itself, and ask you to try again. Mint's support is by far the worst I've ever experienced so hope nothing breaks.- Spotty/slow service and/or deprioritization. As an MVNO, it's understandable that Mint would be deprioritized - especially as a T-Mobile MVNO as T-Mobile is known to heavily deprioritize MVNO users during peak hours. While this depends on your region, from the hours of 10:00am to around mid-night I would classify my LTE speeds as slow. Around 6 - 8mbps download and abysmal uploads of 0.20 - 0.30 (sometimes the test fails on the upload portion). After around 12:00am however my speeds will kick up to 22 - 24mbps down and up to 2 - 3mbps up. When not being deprioritized the speeds are pretty good (aside from upload), but during pretty much all hours of daylight the speeds are nothing special and data service is being deprioritized. For reference, I live in metro Phoenix.- The number assigned to me by Mint was apparently already on a bunch of scam/spam call lists. This isn't inherently Mint's fault, but it would be nice if they would allow me to generate a new number to avoid this - a feature that they, unfortunately, lack. So if you get a bad number when signing up for Mint, you're stuck with it unless you want to try manually requesting a new number (something I have yet to try as their support team is so bad and I really don't want to have to deal with them).- Setting up the service upon receiving a new SIM can be annoying due to some nuances. Sure, it's not extremely hard, but it can definitely be frustrating if you're new to the experience. The activation codes for the SIM cards that I received came with a random letter F at the end of them. Turns out that this wasn't actually a part of the activation code and I couldn't activate the SIM card until I found out that the F shouldn't be there. I was then advised during setup that I would receive an automated text explaining how to set up the APN. That text never came, so I had to manually look it up myself. In some instances, however, you may not even need to use your APN - your phone might automatically set up a T-Mobile one. This depends on your phone, however. As I am familiar with this process, these were minor annoyances and something I could easily work around, but for someone totally new to this experience, I could see it being a point of frustration and causing confusion.All in all, if you don't mind terrible support, broken things remaining broken for an indefinite period of time, and constantly deprioritized/slow data and you're only interested in the price point and unlimited talk/text, Mint definitely is not a bad option - its definitely one of the best price points I've seen. If you're looking for a seamless experience, good data speeds, and consistently working features, however, you may want to consider looking elsewhere.",

The data was barely enough for me to run a few speed tests and check a few websites. I wish they gave 200 MB or so.After the test card dried up I decided to install the second card, order service, and port my Verizon number over. Mint says all that can be done through an app you can download onto your phone. The app doesn't work as well as sitting in front of your computer and doing it on their website. Sometimes the app times out and claims there was an error activating service. Some screens are missing \"back\" buttons. Just use their website.Porting a number from Verizon proved difficult. Part of it was my fault, user error. On the other hand, I think Mint could have been more helpful. My Verizon account number is formatted \"123456789-00001\" on Verizon's website. It turns out I need to add a leading zero and remove the dash (i.e \"-\"). That makes my account number be \"01234567890001\". I lost a day resolving that error. Then I lost another day with the wrong \"Password/PIN\". I thought they wanted my password I use to log into Verizon. Turns out the \"Password/PIN\" is a four digit number I had to create (or once created?) through the website. I lost a day with that mix up. Then I lost more time over a weekend. Then I lost more time when the app said my Mint SIM card could not be validated. Switching to the website re-validated my MINT SIM and finally the number ported over.Mint's customer service is very polite and sincere in their personal effort to want to help ... but their internal screens don't offer much information that can be passed on to us. \"Sorry, didn't work\". \"Sorry, doesn't work on weekends.\" \"Sorry\". \"Sorry\". \"Sorry\". Google was my best friend and it found the information I needed on other carrier sites like US Republic, Boost Mobile, etc.Oh, and be aware of the limited hours the customer service department works. Don't count on being able to call them at 7pm when you come from work. Plan on calling them during your lunch break.Once I got service established then everything worked well enough. Using an app called Speedtest I got download speeds ranging from 1Mbit/sec to over 10 Mbit/sec. A lot depends on not only your location to a T-Mobile tower but the overall traffic load. If overall data traffic is light then you can get some super fast speeds. Otherwise you get bumped down the priority list and your data comes in slowly.80% to 90% of the time I am always on some sort of WiFi connection so I'm not a data power user. Overall the speed and quantity is fine.The one thing Mint has going for it is price. Prepaying for a year ahead of time results in super low prices that are really hard to beat. Just know what you are getting (or not). I'll stick with it for now.So, three stars. If they had the same online guides upfront that competitors have, if their C.S. department had extended hours, and if their app wasn't so poorly programmed then I would bump this to 4 stars if not 5 stars.",

      "body": "After 35 gigs which is understandable a lot it stopped working..  Hopefully, it will reset otherwise I'll have to look into a refund.. because it is supposed to be for 3 months and I'm not through the 1st month..  It still works to call and receive text but will not work as a hotspot which is what I got it for.. So if it works for 35 gigs each month I will be satisfied.. I will update next month..  for now 3 stars for not being truthful because I cannot even run the speed test because it was throttled so low it doesn't work..Pro's:Easy install..Get to pick your own number...Was fast while it worked..ConsIt was throttled so low, internet is unusable..No roaming capabilities that carries like Verizon has thus it sometimes has a weaker signal.. Otherwise it's very good..***EDIT*** 2/23/2023Unless I cannot count, it has been 30 days since I have activated and I am still on throttled (very slow) data which should have reset...  So, I must downgrade my 3 star rating to 1 star since I paid $90 to get 1 month's worth of data rather than 3 months... The phone still works but I got this for the data... I am still going to use the phone but it defeats my original purpose... It is not more cost effective than other plans as such... If things change soon, I'll come back and update... So much for good service!**Edit on 3/5/2023This is terrible solution for a hotspot.. I needed a preplacement for AT&T hotspot which I use on a Nighthawk but I will be forced to go back to them because AT&T is a much better deal for that.. I think it was 100GB for $50 and the 35GB offered with this for hotspot purpose (watching videos, downloads, and using streaming) is just not enough.. You can get more which I did and you pay an additional $20 which I used in 2 days.. It would be real costly to really on mind for streaming or downloading and after 35GB is up the speeds drop down to a trickle..  I'm still going to keep it and for a second phone but haven't really used it for that purpose.. Verizon has better adaptability while roaming so you have to be in a good location for Mint... I am rating it 2 stars at this time.. It is not 3 stars or 4 stars.. They were a bit deceptive about the unlimited..  If they change in the future to better than AT&T I will jump back into their camp  but sorry Mint this doesn't even come close to cutting it..  Oh and as per the previous issue it did reset for the monthly but it's only usable for 35 gigs as stated which is not much for busy people.. I practice real estate and need a lot of mobile data that isn't too costly.",

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2021",
      "body": "If you have just ported your service over from Sprint / Boost / Virgin, there is a potential software issue which could result in you having to buy a new phone.Beware of any Samsung s10e, and likely other models as well, that have been “provisioned” by Sprint or any of it’s subsidiaries. Once it takes the software update that was “pushed out” near the end of 2021, it’s not going to be capable of VoLTE (voice over LTE). This protocol is very important for the proper operation of the phone on the T Mobile / Mint network. And here’s the kicker: The IMEI checker on Mint’s own web site, as well as many of the VoLTE checkers on the Google Play Store, will report that your phone is capable. Boost / Dish Network apparently removes the “switch” from the “Mobile Networks” property tag thru this update. So there is no way to enable VoLTE. This makes the phone “downshift” to 3G mode, which is going away.I am a retired systems engineer with over 25 years of experience in the computer field. And I just spent over 2 weeks troubleshooting this problem! The solution is to “flash” an earlier version of the operating system to the phone. (Much easier said than done!) When I did this, the phone worked properly until 3:00am the following morning when the phone again took an update to it’s Android operating system without my approval. So I had to “flash” the phone again. This time I used ADB (the Android debugging console) to permanently disable automatic updating.This is far beyond the skill level of the average user, and I’m not going to get involved in Boost / Dish Network’s decision to “brick” VoLTE on every Samsung device they ever sold. And the bad part, they could “brick” your phone with an update right after you’ve just renewed Mint Mobile for a year. At this point, you’re going to be stuck shelling out $$$ for a new phone!Mint is still a good service at a very reasonable price. But I had to drop my rating from 5 stars to 3 over this issue.",

The plan is affordable and works well in strong signal areas, but the network reliability can be a concern.

When were they sent?  I just got the line, I need to see it. Basically she just said “sorry we can’t get into that right now.”So now I’m thinking, they reuse old phone lines that are either compromised or reported as spam!How’s that my fault?!

Call quality is ok, but guess it depends what area you’re in and what phone device you’re using.I’m going to pass on this next time. Unless they somehow can reassure me that my texts aren’t being read, and that they’re not giving me an old phone number that’s listed as spam!! 🙄*fyi I haven’t even text anyone outside my family with this mint mobile number because I’m just testing it.Testing failed.",

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2019",
      "body": "I have to say that these is worst service that I have ever had. It's not the signal that is the problem, I have a fantastic signal strength, the only problem is, that I have no internet. I knew that mint mobile used T-mobile service towers which was good because I have a T-mobile 4G LTE phone that's unlocked. The problem is, in Central Kentucky, T-mobile cellular technology is over 16 years old in this area.  I looked over T-mobile's coverage map and it states that it has 4G LTE service in this area with verified addresses showing. I went to each address to see if I could pick up a 4G or LTE signal and I did verify that there is no 4G or LTE in these area at all. I Scanned every tower and every cellular channel thinking that they were maybe transmitting on a none standard frequency but no, there is no 3G, no HSPA, no HSPA+, no 4G, and no LTE.  The only thing they have out here is 16 year old 2G edge and that is it. If they had 3G UMITS out here, it wouldn't be too bad but with 2G you can pretty much say that you don't have internet because you don't.  All you can do is talk, text and get emails. If you want to use the internet, expect it to be slower than a 14.4 modem with constant time outs.  When October gets here, I'm switching back to AT&T and or Verizon because I know I will be getting at least 3G or faster speeds so I can get some work done.  I switched from Straight Talk using AT&T to Mint Mobile because I was trying to boycott Walmart for their dishonest practices but I guess I will have to deal with them until I leave this area.Update  1-4-20I'm now using Cricket which uses AT&T Towers, and everywhere I go, I get LTE and please note that this is not a AT&T phone. It is an Unlocked T-Mobile branded Blackberry Z30. Unfortunately, having your phone stuck in LTE mode all the time runs your battery down very quickly. So I put the sim card in my old  Unlocked T-Mobile Blackberry Torch 9810 and it works flawlessly. The battery will last for 2 days without having to be charged every day and the internet speed is faster than 3G. It's in HSPA+ mode everywhere I go and it seems to be just a fast as LTE without the constant battery drain.Before I switch from Mint Mobile to Cricket. I had to contact Mint Mobile to get my account number and pin number. They asked me why I was leaving and I told them that I could not get 3G, 4G, or  LTE in this area . It didn't matter where I was in Central Kentucky, all I could get was 2G only -- The only place that I could get 4G was in Bardstown, Kentucky.. Would you believe that they tried to tell me my phone was outdated and I needed to purchase a new phone in order to receiver 4G in this area.  Of course I know what a lie is, and they were lying. The Blackberry 9810 and Z30 where released before there time, they were future phones that Blackberry had to release ahead of schedule because of the pressure from Apple and Android.  A lot of people don't understand why someone would want an old Blackberry phone. Well the answer is simple.. I don't care for features, I want rock solid security, that is my main priority because mine is used for business.",

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2019",
      "body": "Update:Increasing rating from one to three stars because although this particular trial kit product didn't ever work for me last year (likely due to Amazon having a bad batch of cards at that time), I have since given them another chance.  I bought a 3-month prepaid Mint card from Best Buy when it was on sale, and that card activated just fine.  I was even able to activate it without entering credit card info, though it was a bit tricky.  I didn't port in a number so I don't know how well that part works, but the service itself worked fine and was a pretty good value.Original Review:I tried ordering this starter/trial kit from Amazon but the included SIM activation code came back as invalid, both on the app and on the Mint Mobile web site.  It could not even start the process of activation.I contacted Mint via phone, and although they did pick up the call very fast, they were pretty clueless and suggested I just contact Amazon to replace the bad SIM.  I dutifully requested a return/replacement through Amazon, and two days later, lo-and-behold, the activation code included with the new replacement SIM is invalid too.  It seems that Amazon's current stock of these cards (at least as of April 16th 2019) may all be bad.I contacted Mint again and the only other option they could offer was to return the second SIM kit to Amazon as well,  and then order a third starter kit directly from Mint (which, by the way, requires entering credit card info).I'd like to test out the service, but Amazon and Mint are making this very difficult to achieve, and if it's this hard to even get a working free trial, it doesn't bode well for what I might expect if I were to sign up as a paying customer.  I understand this is low-cost no-frills service, so that may explain why they can't simply re-authorize the SIM card Amazon sent me, like any normal carrier probably would, but it still doesn't seem like a good sign.I may still give it a try since this could just be the result of an Amazon mixup, but if it doesn't work this time, three strikes and they're out.",

      "body": "I have been using Mint Mobile for around 4 months now and feel I have a fair amount of experience to be able to leave a comprehensive review. I've been using their service with my iPhone 7+ and left a three star review due to the following pros and cons:Pros:- Amazing price point for having decent service and good data options (compared to big-box carriers like Verizon and T-Mobile)- Easy to chat with customer support (although occasionally long wait times)- Plug & play - you get the sim card and nothing is complicated about activating your phone with your old number and getting the card installed.- Easy renewal options right from the app (did I mention the great pricing?)- No extra service fees, terms, conditions to get hit with like a lot of the larger cell carriers - this is nice!Cons:- IMPORTANT - Mint Mobile does not offer group message compatibility between iPhone and Android phones - You will not be able to send messages in chats that have users with both phone types - iMessage works fine AND you can send one-on-one messages between users of the two different operating systems BUT not group messages.- IMPORTANT - You cannot send photos via text to users outside of your operating system (I cannot send my family photos from my iPhone to their Android phones).- When you are in high-usage areas, your data and phone service slows WAY down due to the fact that Mint piggybacks off of T-Mobile towers but T-Mobile gives their immediate customers priority - this is a big issue when at sporting events, fairs, and downtown areas.Once again, as a recent college grad who made it through debt free but then had no money for a hefty Verizon phone bill, Mint has done a great job putting out a few solid options for both data and phone service at a very competitive price point. That said, once I have exhausted my current, six-month plan with Mint, I will likely be transitioning to a larger carrier with more consistent coverage and a lot better group message compatibility.If Mint Mobile were to fix these somewhat small compatibility issues, I am pretty sure I'd be hooked for life.",

So I purchased this plan on Amazon and was going to add it to my free trial and convert it into the Unlimited plan. Well you can’t do that without having to set up a new account with a new number. Changing a phone number is annoying, especially because so much of our lives it tied to using our phones to authenticate accounts we have and nobody loves updating everyone with their new number.I reached out to the Mint customer support 6 times and spent close to 10 hours on the phone or in chat with them trying to convert my plan over with this plan purchased on Amazon. They seemed annoyed to attempt to help me, offered zero solutions for my issue and then would tell me to do something and then later say that I couldn’t. Example of that was I was told to return my plan on the mint website and they would process the return so that I could process the in app purchase of the plan. I was then denied that return because I purchased it through Amazon.The reps leave poor notes on your account so you continue to have to explain your situation to every new person and I truly haven’t encountered a brand with less care about customer first solutions than Mint mobile in years. And I literally mean years, probably a decade.At the end of the day I had to change numbers again in order to use the plan which left a very bad taste in my mouth and honestly is really annoying. Mint is selling a product on Amazon that’s not compatible with what is purchased through them and it’s almost like they intentionally punish you and refuse any customer service help at all because of that. I yield caution to anyone making this purchase so that you don’t run into the same frustrating issue that I ran into. And there should be a clear warning on Amazon noting the lack of compatibility of this product with Mints app. Otherwise it’s misleading to consumers and doesn’t feel very customer centric at all.",

It sounded perfect, since they don't have everything bundled (i.e. 2, 3, 4 phones in order to get all phones with a single data package), but low rates for each individual phone.  I use some data, not a lot, but the other 2 use almost none, so I could get the $20 plan, and they could use the $15.  $50 total for the 3.  It's also on the same T-Mobile network that metroPCS uses.  I was dropping one phone, and just looking to get the 3 phones covered, so I ordered the trial to check it out...I got the 2 sim cards.  Put one in an old Samsung S5 (I wasn't about to use it in my real phone), and got all sorts of error messages.  It generated a new phone number for me, and would work for calls, but no LTE.  I called tech support, and they answered very quickly, and said that it was likely that the phone wasn't \"completely unlocked\" (?)  So, I moved the SIM to an iPhone 6... similar results.  I called tech support (again, they answered very quickly), and they said I'd used all 100 MB of LTE data on that SIM...  I hadn't downloaded anything!  It usually takes me about 2 to 3 days to download 100 MB via LTE, since I mostly use home Wi-Fi for downloads,  and I hadn't had this SIM card in for more than a few hours.Anyway, I was still willing to give them a trial with my real phone.  First I made sure it was completely unlocked.  I installed the second SIM card, and went through the process of activating the card following the instructions on the app.  When I tried to port my number, which is one I've had for literally 30 YEARS (so I don't want to lose it), it said that the SIM card had already been activated, so I couldn't port a old number to it...  Again I called tech support, and they answered promptly, and informed me that my SIM card could not be ported to my number, since a new number had already been generated.  They said I'd have to order a new SIM card.  They also said that I'd already used all my 100 MB of LTE data on my new card that had been in the phone for about an hour.  I asked if they would just send another SIM card, and I'd try it again.  They said I had to go buy a new trial packet on Amazon.  I said, \"Thank you, Good bye.\"The whole idea of paying low-cost up front works perfect for me, but these guys can't, at this point, deliver any sort of phone service to me.  Maybe it's a flawed app, a flawed system... who knows.  If you've got 10 - 20 hours of spare time to spend setting it up a new phone line, give it a try.  I tried, and gave up.  At least when you call Tech Support, in my case, they actually answered the phone...",

The switch was difficult, took almost a week to get it straightened out between Tracfone & Mint (each blaming the other, of course) and it's been a difficult transition from my Samsung Galaxy J7 to the Moto that I'm still attempting to get all the kinks out but then again, I'm not tech savvy when it comes to phones either (better with laptops, DVD & VCR players & TV's). Anyhoo, my 3 month trial is almost up so I looked at the plans now available, thinking I was going to be able to purchase 3 months at $15 a month for $45 total. WRONG!!!!!  In order to get the $15 a month, I have to pay for a YEAR up-front! That's $180 for only 4GB! 3 months at the 4GB is $75!!!! When I contacted Mint thru their Chat, I spoke with Leonardo (who couldn't spell to save his life making it a much longer convo than necessary as I was trying to figure out what he was attempting to say) and basically said everything that I already read (he included screenshots too). Told him I'm on disability so I'm on a very, very strict budget hence always having a prepaid cell  The only thing he suggested was to buy a new SIM Card so I could get the \"new customer\" price. Seriously?! Told him how upset I am with these prices and all he did was continually say \"you have to pay upfront for all packages\"... DUH! I knew that, nothing is for free! Told him he's loosing a customer and he said \"sorry\" and that was that.Now I'm having to either go back to the dreadful Tracfone or research the other services out there within the next 10 days before I loose my service entirely. Some of this is my fault cuz I should have researched Mint more but all the TV & online ads I saw/read implied (to me, at least) that I could buy 3 months for $45 total every time I had to renew my minutes (started with 10GB but easily could do with just 4GB). I could afford that but not their plans for existing customers. Typical bait & switch scheme. Totally ticked off! Plus their App & Customer Service aren't that great, no better than Tracfone and that's just sad. Expected so much more!!!The service itself has been \"spotty\" at best. Whether trying to make a call while inside a store or getting the store App to work while shopping definitely is not guaranteed. WTH 😫👎Oh and Leonardo suggested I \"refer a friend to join\" so I could get a discount that way. Like I said to him \"Don't think so! Not gonna ruin a friendship for a discount\"! Argh🤬",

If you want to keep your old number when becoming a Mint Mobile customer with the two sim system you are asked something like \"Do you want Mint Mobile to assign you a number or keep your old number?\" after changing sim cards.If you want to do the same thing with Amazon you must use the Mint Mobile app. When activating the sim card for permanent use, after starting the activation you are asked something like \"Do you want to keep the temporary number or use your old number?\"I got into trouble when I did not want to lose my old number and took an extra precaution. I called Mint  Mobile and asked to be guided through the process so that I would be certain not to lose my old number. The agent then asked me all the questions needed to transfer the number and said the number would be transferred within 24 hours while I could still use the temporary number while waiting. What the agents, he or she, didn't know is that it doesn't work that way, it assigns you the temporary number as your permanent number. This is what happened with three different agents.Through Amazon I finally reached a Mint Mobile agent who knew what went wrong. The solution was to cancel everything that had been done, get a refund for the three month discount period that I bought, order a new sim card from them, and make sure that my old number was active which involved paying for another month with the company that I want to leave.I will know in a month whether this works.UPDATEHere is how to port a number, I learned from YouTube.1. Go to MintMobile..com2. On top click activate3. Use the Account Code on the chip card4. Pick keep your your old number5. Follow the instruciionsIt worked for meEvery customer service person that I dealt with was in Mexico or the Dominican Republic.  They (one eception) do not know how to port a number.",

Good concept IF IT WORKS,It doesn’t work with all phones so please check your basic compatibility ahead ,In my area ( including metro) coverage with Tmobile network that Mint is using is spotty (like spot the signal spotty) - check ahead, ask friends,I have to say it’s advertised well, i.e. Fox is super cute, services promised seem seamless and what attracted me is, international calls are great value.BUTCustomer service consisting of logging into an app and texting with a bot before it takes pity on you and let’s you text with human is frustrating to say the least,In my experience 5 days now,I am paying with no service - no texts, no calls ability,Nothing except hours of texting with different agents who ask the same questions without simply checking your case notes (every interaction has session ID)Agents take their time answering or ignoring basic, basic questions, i.e. 2 minutes to tell you “I am still here” is not cool in any case.When you text with human customer service agent a popup tells you - “you are first in line and wait time is 5 minutes”, on many occasions it was 10 - 15  in my case.Solutions I was offered varied from :Reset all network settings and don’t worry - we won’t loose contact, (lol - but not really funny)Would you like to get another number?,Would you like to (ignore all this mess and) port your AT&T number to Mint ?,The real gem for me wasCan you find a friend and ask them for their phone then take their SIM out and put your Mint SIM in just to see if it works, (I was going to ask do I then run away with their phone if it works ?)Next one was, OK we will contact you by phone or text (well hello- how you gonna do that? we just spent an hour getting to know each other with me boring you and talking about the fact that I can’t text or phone or receive either)Like I said, in my case it’s total waste of time,5 days on  and today they informed me that my case is now finally elevated to T mobile tech support and it would hopefully be resolved within further 48 hours,So still waiting, with no serviceBy the way, I am not even porting my number, which allegedly causes way more issues, I am just getting “plain vanilla, of the shelf” number and trying to participate in simple everyday exercise consisting of:  here’s my money, I have up to date compatible iPhone please can I have service?So far it’s “OK we’ll take your money” - not good Mint mobile.As a suggestionIf you have new (wanting to be a) customer, and they have 3 what they rated as “unsatisfactory” interactions with 3 different agents, red flag should go up and case be quickly examined to either hopefully say HI  rather than BYE to that customer,Thanks",

Any time I attempt to call it will pause for a solid 15 seconds, do nothing than after that 15 seconds it will drop LTE/5G pick up a signal, place the call and work (however it couldn't receive calls).Once the call ends back to no signal yet LTE/5G, this phone supports every LTE band T-Mobile uses (Mint works on T-Mobiles network). It makes absolutely no sense, spent hours trying APN's, nothing could get it to show a signal, and have LTE at the same time. I later remembered I had a older phone which I used on T-Mobile a few years back.Same exact issue, even though I know for a fact this device has worked with T-Mobile without issue. I'm just so confused as to what is going on, I couldn't get the sim to fully work on two separate ones, one being a phone T-Mobile, and Mint sell themselves. Both phones are unlocked, I kinda feel defeated in a way, I did a lot of searching online and this seems to be a kinda common issue, as far as I've read no one really has a solution.Not sure if its just an APN issue which hasn't been addressed or a semi-faulty sim card. Either way I couldn't really get either phone to work with it to a reasonable degree. Not upset, only in it for $1 I don't mind that at all, just more confuses as to what is causing this issue, and why there seems to be no solution too it online."

This risk free trial seemed like a great idea. I was able to carry around both of my phones and compare coverage. I live in a medium-sized city, and while the bars on my phones seemed to indicate that Republic was getting a better signal, I was receiving text messages and phone calls on both phones just fine. There was only once instance where I was walking around a large retail store and the phone call got crackly for a minute on the Mint service. I am planning to switch to Mint Mobile.Now for the bad. The instructions that they claim are so easy are NOT easy. I activated the first card for the trial, and it states right on the postcard they send with the SIM cards that you should use the second SIM card when you're ready to activate and transfer your phone number. This was not the case for me - I put in the second SIM card and it activated a second trial (NOT what I needed). I'm not sure if I missed something or what, but I'm generally pretty technologically inclined, so if I screwed something up it means it is probably pretty easy to do it wrong. I messaged them through their web site for support, and to their credit I received a phone call within a few minutes of sending the message. Their solve was to purchase a plan from their web site, which means this was not actually risk free, I lost the $5 that was supposed to roll in to purchasing the plan.",

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2021",
      "body": "This is the first time I have written an Amazon review. Somewhat of a minor problem is that I had to acquired three trial mint cards because the first two were defective. I expended about 45 minutes in each call with tech support regarding the first two mint cards. Thereafter, I went to a local store having the mint card and purchased the third. Tech support was able to activate it.Now the major problem, at least from my perspective. After a few days, I decided to switch to mint. The bottom line is that I had to call them nine times over two days because they still had not transferred my telephone number from my cellular carrier to mint. Each time I called, over two days, I informed the agent of the number of calls that I had had to make untilt that point. I also expressed my continuing frustration of how time-consuming it was to have to make so many telephone calls, some calls being 45 minutes, 30 minutes and so forth.I even insisted on speaking to a manager. Speaking to him was a waste of time. All he did was reiterate what a previous agent had told me, that is, that my account had been escalated. Finally, during the second day, as mint still failed to transfer my current telephone number to my new cellular telephone, I telephoned mint for the ninth time--frustratingly. The agent again spent time looking at my account and essentially giving me the same song and dance that it takes time and so forth and so forth. Having enough, I told mint to refund my money. I do not want to imagine what I would have experienced if I became a customer and had cellular problems.Notably, I live in one of the largest metropolitan areas in the country. Therefore, it is not like I live in some obscure area where they are having difficulty transferring my telephone number. Also, I have current cellular service with a major carrier. Consequently, why and how it is that mint has such difficulties transferring my current telephone number from my current carrier--even after the situation was escalated--not to mention nine telephone calls, conveys perhaps their incompetence.I haven't done a nationwide study of others and what they have experienced. I am just telling you what I experienced. The reason why am telling you this is because I don't want you to have to go through the frustration and the unnecessary waste of time making numerous calls--in my case, nine telephone calls over two days of what should have been a fairly simple issue.If you have a lot of free time and you don't mind making multiple telephone calls, then this is probably the company for you. As far as the actor who owns this company, he is a good actor. However, he is a poor business owner--at least from what I experienced. Good luck.",

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2019",
      "body": "On paper, Mint Mobile can be a great value, but that largely depends on whether you have good T-Mobile coverage in your area. If you don't, you might be better off looking into Red Pocket, which offers similar \"buy in bulk\" annual prepaid plans but allows the customer to choose one of 4 major cellular networks to use (AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, T-Mobile).I appreciate Mint Mobile's gradual investment model: you can try the trial SIM for $5, then upgrade to the 3-month introductory offer (for now), before committing to one of the max-value annual prepaid plans. For me, it was obvious with the $5 trial that the signal quality was too weak in my area to justify the savings.The other issue I had with Mint was SIM activation: the mobile app and website indicated that my SIM was invalid. I had to call Mint Mobile multiple times to provide the Activation Code, Amazon Order Number, and SIM Number before they manually activated the SIM card on their end. The over-the-phone service was generally good, but the representatives seemed confused and had difficulty resolving the issue.I also noticed that some of their branding is the old Mint SIM, as seen on the card. Even though the website and mobile app are generally user-friendly and polished, this branding mismatch seemed to reflect the rough, cost-cutting reputation associated with these minimalist MVNO prepaid carriers.If you have good T-Mobile signal in your area, I would still recommend trying Mint. They're definitely more professional and fully-featured than most other MVNO prepaid plan providers with some of the best prices for Unlimited Messages & Minutes in the industry.",

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021",
      "body": "My experience with this company has been total misery!  I would advise you to run far away and not risk your money or phone number.I wanted to test T-Mobile service, particularly WiFi calling, since I live in a remote area with terrible cell coverage.  My current service with ATT is very weak and goes completely away frequently, and ATT refuses to allow WiFi calling on any device that you did not purchase directly from them, even if your phone does have that capability.This test kit allowed me to confirm that T-Mobile coverage here at my house is even worse than ATT (very weak signal outside. zero signal inside), and it showed me that my phone does have WiFi calling capabilities as an option in the system settings (not there with an ATT SIM), but I could not get that feature to work.  Mint Mobile tech support at first was no help at all, and eventually someone just said it was not enabled on test accounts.  Sounded a lot like a cop-out from someone who did not know very much.To actually test WiFi calling, I had to pay for a full service account (MINIMUM 3 months in advance), and only after that I discovered that to enable that functionality, you have to go into your Mint Mobile account and turn it on after entering your e911 address.  I suspect they should have been able to do this with the test account, but they didn't seem to know that.  Anyway, Mint Mobile claims to have a 7-day refund policy, so I did this to test this feature, verify that it DOES work on my phone with a T-Mobile SIM, and then cancel the account for a refund.  Unfortunately, the company is playing games and refuses to honor their refund policy!  They say that that the 7 days started with the test SIM, so I am a sucker for giving them any more money to actually activate a full account, despite the fact that THEY TOLD ME that is what I had to do.I chose not to stay with Mint Mobile because of their onerous pricing scheme where you are forced to pay for an entire year in advance to get any competitive prices on service, but now I would not stay with them for free.",

      "body": "Probably like most people, I got a little tired of paying a LOT of money for mobile phone service.  Our 2 phones and 1 cellular iPad were costing $133 a month with 10 GB of data.  I decided to try Mint Service on my iPad as it would not disrupt the phone numbers, while I was trying the service out.  You activate the service from the Mint web site, put in the SIM card and away you go.  No muss, no fuss.  Mint uses T-Mobile towers, so if you can get T-Mobile reception you should be good to go.After the successful iPad experiment, I ordered 2 more SIMS for our phones.  Total time between activating the cards, inserting the SIM and having the number ported over from Verizon was under 7 minutes. Probably another minute to set up the Voice Mail.Be aware, that this is pre-paid service, as supposed to the normal post paid contract.  Difference is you prepay 3 months, 6 months or 12 months.  The longer you prepay, the cheaper the service.  In our case we have 3 GB of data per phone for $15 per month apiece by prepaying for 12 months.  My iPad  I have 8 GB of data and it is $20 a month.  The total for all 3 phones is $54.16 ( tax and 911 fees) a month versus the $133 I was paying Verizon and my data increased from 10 GB to 14 GB per month.  Dropping my bill 60% and increasing my data by 40% was a good use of my time.I have had the SIM cards in for a few days now but all is working just as it was before.  If there is any reason to update this review, I will do so.Update:  first time I have taken a review from 5 star to 1 star.  After two days, the voice mail on my iPhone switched from being on the iPhone to now having to dial into another system to access it.  In addition, there is no message that alerts you there is a Voice Mail.  Mint is unable to solve this and their support people have no access to tech support. They open up a case and I am supposed to hear back in 24-48 hours. Well 24 hours has passed with no resolution. Initially they tried to blame it on Apple, but I was having none of that.  This is a Mint problem that only they can solve. I can not wait much longer to get this resolved and looks like I am going to have to go back to Verizon and their high bills. But I guess you get what you pay for.  Support people are not empowered to solve problems, other than standard non answers, like reboot,  call Apple or take the SIM card out. I am way beyond underwhelmed.",

Mint Tech Support told me not to buy these from Amazon, most of the activation codes are invalid. Well if they knew that, why let this store continue selling them? At 99¢ a pop, this isn't a get rich quick scheme, so what gives?For the trial sim cards, you ABSOLUTELY need to install the Android/iOS APP to even attempt to activate them. So, you can't use it in a MiFi device (Jetpack, Orbic, ZMax, Nighthawk, Inseego, GL Colie, etc.) unless it has an Android/i...OS. Perhaps the normal plan sim cards work in those devices without having to activate using the app.Tech support tier 1 and 2 are completely clueless, they just read from scripts, and are useless when the issue is \"off-script\". No tier 3+ with any technical knowledge to be found. I needed to talk to a curiously stronger \"Altoids\" class of support, not Junior Mints. O.oI'm highly irate, since I needed it to work for my road trip. I had to fall back to another carrier that has a VERy low signal strength near the horIZON. I can't mention the name in the review section though, so I won't.Yeah, I'm out only 99 cents x 2 (math hurts my brain), but that wasn't the point. I needed a working sim card, and they said it was quick and painless, unlike Ryans' other ventures like, Green Lantern, The Voices, The Proposal, DeadGuy, Aviation AVgas, etc.. (See a trend?)Ok, I went off-script again, my bad. You get the point. I wanted to try this too good to be true virtual network operator, but alas, I'll have to wait another day, week, month, or even perhaps years until the (non-trial) real card arrives.<sigh>",

      "body": "After reading all negative review, I still decided to give it a try. You know what, all of them are correct. So nothing new here. In short, trial sim works, porting number doesn't work, customer support is slow to respond and helpless. Wasted $5 and 5 days of my time.Full story: I really had high hopes for the mint mobile, as they prices sound right and additional services for roaming and international calls are exactly what I need. Trial sim was installed with no problems and number was assigned. Data and mms configuration is semi - automatic on iphone (you'll get sms that you need to accept) and manual on android (you need to enter 3-4 config lines). But everything works ok after a day of testing on both devices. Issues start when I decided to 'make it official'. App instructions are non existent, so mint has successfully charged me for the full promo plan and that was it. Trying to port number on the next screen gives the error, no explanation what to do and credit card was already charged. The only option is to contact mint support. I was aware about helpless support by phone with hang ups and requesting the same info again and again, so I decided to keep it organized and use emails. No big difference, other than that it takes 24h to get a reply on every email exchange, so it was really slow communication. They asked for 'Act Code' and 'OSP' among the other of usual pin and ICCID. Does anybody know what 'Act Code' and 'OSP' stand for? Google doesn't know, as well as t-mobile prompt support. The answer is  'Activation Code' and 'Old Service Provider'. After all info was provided (I was hoping so), I didn't get a reply for more than 24h. So I've decided to request a refund, considering it was Friday, no idea if they work on weekends and we're getting close to the end of 7 days refund window. Still no reply from the original support person. But Saturday morning I got an email from a different person on a separate request I made about a refund. I've replied to it and 24h after got a confirmation that refund was issued and should appear in 24-48 business hours. They really need to invest into automating everything and have correct error messages and clear instructions about what to do next in the app to avoid unnecessary communication with the support. Why charge the card before the port is successful? Would be much better just to place a hold on card and charge after everything is ported successfully.",

The only way you can bring your current number is to sign up for one of the monthly plans then you can. Not an issue took the 8G 3 month plan and going to give it a try and see how it goes. I will say the service isn't too bad but I can't say how strong the 4G is because I am on WiFi most of the time and no idea how the 5G is because I have not upgraded to a 5G phone yet. The app is nice because it shows you your usuage but several times in just the first few weeks it said the app was not working and then when it was it said I had used all my data for the month but then it updated and said I had almost all my data left so I would have to see how it goes and see if this is a reoccurring issue because I know I don't use any data because I am on WiFi most of the time. Good deal for cell phone service compared to all of the major carries for what you get. Going to be able to save several hundreds of dollars a year now.",

The service just did not work for me, and of course, they only give you 7 days to ask for a refund & to try out the service, I had such high hopes. I purchased 3 of these & the service was bad for all 3 phones. Now I'm out $145 & was not offered a refund on the other 2 months for the 3 lines. I had to turn wifi off and turn data on and only then would my texts come in. One day I had 23 text messages come in at once from my work group chat. I could not send pics through mms or even reply to the group chat. I kept getting a \"Failed\" message. Having to keep turning off and on Wifi and data was the worst, I couldn't have both on at the same time. Phone calls would not go through at times, even in a major metropolitan area (kept searching for network). So if you only need a phone some of the time but not all of the time, this would work for you. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money.UPDATE:I brought it up to 3 stars because they refunded me partially. Customer service was pretty helpful with it.",

It's quite an embarrassment when you have a meeting call in and your leadership team gets your out of office message instead of you. It's actually become a joke.  Like playing Russian roulette.I didn't want to rely on Wi-Fi calling from home, but that is what I ended up doing.  Just set that up today, May 6, 2020.Still on the border if I'll keep this afterwards.  The other phone is used by one of my teens.  It was mainly for data usage which currently isn't being tested since he is pretty much stuck at home.Positive things to note. Setting up both phones was easy. MMS works just fine.  Setting up Wi-Fi calling was a breeze using the Mint App and then completing the rest in the phone settings.  Haven't really needed data, but so far it has worked when needed.",

This is because at least enough of the crowd are official T-mobile users and you only get data crumbs while connected to the same access point. I think this is a function of vicinity (or reserving the data bandwidth for T-mobile users) rather than actual data usage by the crowd because I've never  seen a large amount of people all using their phones at the same time I have reduced data bandwidth (with 3+ bars).We are okay with this huge drawback as we work from home where we aren't fighting for a section of the mobile data pie.",

Activation was relatively easy for my line, but never worked for my husband, so he ended up returning his sim and going forward with a different service. It used to be very difficult to get anyone on the phone for customer service, though they seem to have improved on that front.My coverage was decent for the most part, but it was always slower than my husband's phone or my business phone, and there would be instances where I got zero services while the other two lines did. I spent all of last weekend in Pennsylvania with almost zero service, and that was the final straw for me.Roaming was a bit of a rip off, as I put $20 in roaming credit to cover 2 trips to the UK. On trip 1, it worked fine, but on trip 2 it did not work at all, and I was informed that there were outages due to issues with their roaming partners abroad. When I requested a refund for my nearly $10 in remaining roaming balance because I could not use it, I was denied.Overall, it was OK for the money, with mounting annoyances over time.

As for being able to keep your old phone number it never gave me an option. So when the trial plan ends and I pick a full size plan then I can't bring my phone number with me to this SIM card because it's already been assigned a new number. That is very unsatisfying. So I'll have to order another sim card to keep my old phone number. It's just a matter of which is more of a hassle. To wait until another sim card arrives in the mail or to go ahead and try and notify everybody of a new phone number. Neither option is really good. I would like to know where that second SIM card went though."

Always willing to give someone a chance so called their customer support line to see if I could connect to regular service (albeit temporary, to further evaluate service, but you have to pay for  3 months).  Can't hear the person on the other end of the line due to overwhelming background noise: sounded like a TV on high volume and other persons speaking in loud tones  (it was like trying to talk at a noisy social event).  Not being able to get anything done and the support person did nothing to reduce the noise, I hung up. Don't want this kind of customer support.  Will not switch to Mint regardless of affordability***********Note: for anyone asking about compatible phones or coverage- go online to their site. Many of these sites will let you input the IMEI of your phone and let you know whether or not the phone is compatible.  It will also show you coverage for your area though  I have found that a lot of these sites are very \" generous\" in showing coverage. Unfortunately, a trial Sim might give you more accurate information.To locate phone's IMEI- this is usually located in your phone's \"settings\"  scroll to \"about phone\"If it isn't there check under legal data",

I selected Paypal and got an error that Paypal was inaccessible.  I tried the Credit Card option and tried three different credit cards and all were rejected.I suspected their payment portal was down, and doing a little research I found that this isn't an uncommon issue and that the solution was to turn off WiFi and only use data on the Mint SIM.  I turned off Wifi and restarted the app and the app promptly lost all knowledge of my trial plan and wouldn't take my activation code.  I tried to log in to it from the Web but their site won't take trial plan numbers to sign in.I finally contacted Chat support and after a 10 minute wait was told I had to call them during their normal business hours as they couldn't help me via Chat.

I purchased this for use with my daughter's iPhone 5S. The trial worked very well and she was happy with the service. We decided to purchase a plan at $45 minus the $5 credit back. In total, I spent $42.39. We did the plan purchase through the app on her phone. Once completed, the phone just says \"searching\" under service. If you look in the settings, under phone number it says unknown. If you call her number, it goes straight to voicemail. She cannot make or receive calls, nor send or receive texts, nor does she have any data. Nothing is working at all. I have contacted their customer service and opened a ticket to which there has been absolutely no response.In googling this issue, it appears that there is a known issue with these sim cards. There is a thread on Reddit discussing it. Here's part of what was written on there (it appears to have been written by a representative of Mint Mobile)- \"There is currently an issue with the trial SIMs on 10.2.x - they are misidentified and the APN settings are locked - but it should work correctly. In some cases VVM and WFC may work, but it isn't supported; as those SIMs are being assigned a T-Mobile bundle.The \"fix\" is in iOS 11.3; and those SIMs will then require APN settings, and will not support VVM and WFC.I can absolutely understand how frustrating this is. Rest assured, we work daily to bring VVM, WFC and automatic APN to all customers.\"So, if there's a known issue with these SIMs not working properly, why are they continuing to sell them and why have they not fixed it in the more than 2 months since that thread was posted? And why does their customer service ignore paying customers' requests for help?My advice - run far, far away from this company.",

We went over the BYOD tool and how it confirmed IPAD was supported but, not yet we were told.  We suggested they may want to update the tool then?The tech was outstanding though.  Asked if we would be willing to try a few things to get it to work and spent about 90min on the call.  Spending 90min with any carrier tech can be frustrating and exasperating but it really was a great call.  We ended up being able to get some connectivity to the IPad but it was wicked poor.  The tech reminded us of the 7 day trial policy and we agreed to try it for the day.  We realized it was too poor/slow of a connection for the IPad & ended up trying in my wife’s IPhone SE. Over a few hours had 2 dropped calls and many connection issues so decided to cancel. We completed the cancellation process with Mint and filed a return with Amazon.  Mint Customer Service sent a followup email notifying us Mint no longer supports Amazon refunds so….BEWARE.

Good coverage for my urban area and I decided to purchase a longer plan, but after a few calls back and forth between Mint customer service and my old carrier ATT, they finally determined that it's impossible to purchase a plan with these trial cards and porting your number because the cards are locked. Unfortunately hours were wasted in earlier calls being told that I must have the wrong account info (it wasn't) and told me to contact ATT, who said they had received no requests to port. Earlier tech support told me that it wouldn't work because the trial had expired. (Also not true, still able to make and receive calls a day later and app shows I've got minutes, data and text left.)A third tech had me uninstall and reinstall the app, which still showed the time, data and texts left, so it really wasn't expired. That's when they figured out that you can't port a number and upgrade with these trial cards from Amazon. If you don't care about keeping your old number, you might be fine.  Now I'm waiting for a 90 day service card to arrive so I can start over. They insist that it's a different kind of card that will allow me to port my number. This also means I've lost the $5 credit promised in the item description on this card.",

Unless you are in or near a larger city where you are close to towers service is horrific. My phone will constantly loose the ability to connect, notice I didn't say it looses signal. It will show that I have signal sometimes 3 or 4  bars just no connection. It will not send or receive texts or phone calls or internet data. I have to frequently restart my phone just to try and force it to connect to a tower. I cannot wait until we switch to another carrier again. I will never use mint mobile again and would NEVER recommend it to anyone. Unlimited data doesn't mean anything if you cannot connect to use any of it. The inability to even make phone calls makes it a safety issue with me as well. Being able to get ahold of family is my primary reason for having phones and with mint you are not much better off than not having a phone at all. Tech support is of little or no help. Their best option is \"restart your phone and see if it will connect to a tower\" Same phones worked great on AT&T which is who I will probably be going back to. I would rather pay more money and have the peace of mind that I can reach my family when I need to.",

      "body": "BEFORE purchasing this starter kit, I checked my phone's IMEI number on the Mint Mobile website with their \"IMEI checker\". It indicated that my phone could be used on their network. Thereafter I ordered the starter kit. Following the instructions received, I inserted the 1st starter kit SIM card. Everything seemed to go well and it setup nicely. Then I was to go to Google Play Store and download the 'Mint Mobile app\". Problem was when using my phone with the Mint Mobile SIM#1, it would NOT  show me the \"Mint Mobile\" app ANYWHERE in the  Google Play Store. I checked thoroughly and tirelessly and after hours of looking, I finally gave up. I took the phone, (originally a T-Mobile device now unlocked), to an AT&T Mobile store. They inserted their SIM into it and it worked fine, so I know this phone works on a GSM network. Then I contacted Mint Mobile tech/customer support. They asked if I checked the IMEI number before ordering this starter kit. Yes, I told them, I had, and I had made a screen shot of Mint Mobile telling me my phone was compatible with their network. However, now, talking with their tech/customer support, they looked at their information, (i.e., for my phone's IMEI number), and told me my phone was only 20& compatible with their network. The compatibility check I ran from their website NEVER said anything other than the fact that my phone WAS compatible with their network. If they had told me it was only 20% compatible - during my original IMEI check - I wouldn't have ordered this starter kit. So, really, I unnecessarily ordered this starter kit, when I actually could have been warned against doing that because Mint Mobile knew it was only SLIGHTLY compatible with my phone. That is what's BOTHERSOME to me about this whole process, to say the least.",

I spoke to two people, none of them could solve the problem, they just say buy another sim, yet they said their website had problems and that is why I could not activate the sim to port over.No good to solve problems. A real problem with this company and when you call them, they cannot solve the problems, they just say buy another sim, the way they have things set up is bad for customers, they need to improve their detailed steps, like saying don't insert sim until you activate it online, but trying to do it online sometimes won't work, their website was down and not working, the guy told me when I called, yet would not send me another sim for free, I had already spent $5 on sims, a real fiasco with Mint. I think they could be good if they can work out the kinks. Will try to get refund I guess. The big problem with this company and sim is that when you put the sim in your phone it automatically activates it, so don't do it, do it online first then put it in your phone I guess. It is all very unclear and I was not happy at all when you call them, they cannot help, they just say buy another sim. They should not make it so both sims in this kit can be trial sims, that is the problem with this starter kit. I am sure it could be good once they work out all the kinks, but was not happy with the calls and they did nothing just say buy another sim, they should be able to solve problems when you call them. Hope this helps people with Mint.",

I have called customer service practically every other day and they always give me excuses for why I have no service. When I first called back on August 9, they told me the cell tower near me was under maintenance and would take 2-3 days to fix.  After that, they would have me try the same thing that didn't work over and over again - reset your phone, network, take out the sim card, etc. It's not my phone -- they have confirmed that my phone is 4G and supports VOLTE and should have no problems.Today, I called customer service again and guess what? They are still giving me the same excuses -- cell tower near you is under maintenance. For almost a month now? Ok, can you give me an ETA on when that will be completed? Nope, we can't give you that. And all this happened after I just renewed their service for an entire year. What good is it if I have NO service and can't use it?Dealing with customer service got me nowhere.

Its pretty annoying. From the other reviews it seems clear that this happens a lot. I ended up telling her I would get another sim kit and had to hang up because she starts insisting \"we can fix this, please don't go\" - no, if you could fix it, you would have already.So just be careful, DO NOT follow the instructions, I think some other reviewers say go online and start the plan before putting the \"second sim\" in the phone.I am not sure if I will bother with another trial pack, I am nearly ready to go back to the criminals (ATT, Verizon etc.) and their outrageously priced plans and their HARD credit checks.",

My phone now essentially has no service, what am I supposed to do? Find a pay phone to contact you about the problems I'm having? (haha) I figure there is no humans there that can actually help, though either. That is enough for me to figure it's not worth it even if its cheap. I know that helps lower the price but it does me no good if you can't actually use the service.Third: The set up process is a lot harder than they lead you on to believe. There is a lot of set up involved, which for someone who is not tech-savvy, can be a bit of a struggle to make sure you have the data entered correctly at every point. I wasted at least half an hour of my time for no reason whatsoever.Overall, I am VERY DISSATISFIED with Mint Mobile Free Trial which certainly leads me to believe their actual service would suck as well.  So glad I only paid a dollar for this, because it's going right in the trash.

      "body": "After I ordered Mint service for three months I received their \"cleverness kit\" in  the mail. It contained a SIM card and activation code. I misplaced the little credit card sized slip of paper with the activation code on it after installing the SIM card in my phone. I went on their app for assistance and it insisted that I enter the activation code before it would help me. I spent on hour on the phone trying to talk to a human being and their telephone tree hung up on me three times before I gave up. I went to their web site and did an online chat with someone who required a picture of my bank statement showing I had paid for three months service before they would help me and then disconnected me while I was working to shoot a screen shot of my credit card statement. I got back on chat with a second person who said she could find no record of my purchase since it was not activated which put me right back at the start of the whole process. She told me I would have to cancel my order through Amazon to get a refund from them. Amazon is requiring me to return the product to them which is only an empty \"cleverness kit\" envelope. Which means I will probably have trouble getting my money back from them. Total nightmare!",

Not as fast as my straight T-Mobile SIM that I've had for years, but I understand Mint has to throttle data speed in order to make some money.Decided it was fast enough though, and upgraded to a full account SIM with 3 months prepaid service.And now I get HARDLY any data... so little that I can't even run Pandora, Google Maps says I'm off line and SpeedTest reports network errors.Wow.  Just wow. And that's not a good wow.When I was with Tmobile (6 years at this address), I could even do Facetime over cellular data and now I can't even run Pandora. What irks me most is that Mint is basically saying \"we have poor coverage at your address\" while I know that's complete bull. Their trial SIM had no problems but their \"real\" SIM does.Talked to Tech Support and they basically said Mint does not have good coverage in my area (I'm in a sub-urb of Seattle, 12 miles from the city!). Never mind that T-Mobile never had any problems here and their trial SIM worked well enough! When I asked why the 7day trial SIM would work, he had no answer.So... classic bait & switch. Not sure how they think that's a good way to build your brand because I, for one, will now tell everyone how lousy Mint Mobile really is and how they tricked me in to signing up.Guess the single star is for the fact they do offer a 7-day money back guarantee.Back to T-Mobile it is, then... :*(",

This is what happened: I checked the web site in advance for compatibility - the web site indicated that my device, which was a modem (new purchase that I was attempting to see would work for a particular scenario), was compatible with this prepaid SIM card & service. So I made the purchase. Once the SIM was installed and activated there was no activity, specifically internet. So I checked with support and after some troubleshooting steps was told that the card was bad and a replacement was sent. When the replacement arrived there was confusion on my part as to how to activate the replacement card. So I checked with support who immediately told me that the card would not work in the device. At this point I didn't even take the second SIM card out of the packaging and just wanted to send it all back. The return window for the modem was rapidly closing - it took two weeks to get to this point. Kudos to the support guy who put a rush on the second card - it was very helpful. (and elevated this rating by one star) So to return the cards I would need to contact the original seller for a refund. The cards were returned.I'm unfamiliar with prepaid SIM cards and learned that using them in modems creates difficulties because of the absence of a phone interface. I tried a different carrier's SIM card in the modem and still couldn't get it to work... ended up sending the modem back.",

Unless I initiate a call or text, no calls or texts can come through. Talked to Mint Mobile customer service and technical support. Even though Mint Mobile guys were willing to help, it is the T-mobile's network issues. And T-mobile was not willing to help at all. Their response was unless you buy a phone from T-mobile, your 4G service is not guaranteed to be consistent. The T-mobile guy actually asked me to set my phone to 2G mode. OMG, what a terrible company!!!Stay away from T-mobile!!!!!!!!!!!Original review:Bought the kit from Amazon. The installation of Mint Mobile app was easy and quick. The trial instruction was simple and clear. I only wish the trial SIM had a little bit more data for the trial period. It went too fast and was gone before I realized it. Fortunately my huawei phone has two SIM cards and was able to switch to the other SIM with a few clicks.Switched to Mint Mobile after the trial since their equivalent plan costs as little as half of my old plan. And T-mobile coverage in my city appears as good as, if not better than, the other provider. So moving to Mint Mobile makes sense for me.  I don't know what is going to happen when T-mobile merges with Sprint. I have paid for the whole year and hope they won't change my plan. If they do, then I would have to cancel the plan. So far the calls and data service is OK. Nothing is out of ordinary.",

They instruct you to enter the SIM card number but they don't tell you NOT to include the letter at the end, so I wasted a fair amount of time being frustrated by that until I tried it without and finally got to the next step.  Then you're supposed to get a text message with a code that automatically configures your VPN and other settings,  but since my phones never established cellular connections,  no text arrived.  I went through the manual instructions for network setup,  restarted phone multiple times,  airplane mode on/off, still no good. Consulted multiple online forums and finally got the right settings which were not what Mint provided. Phones started working,  but the voicemail set up instructions on the Mint SIM website also did not work.Established Google Voice on one of the devices, but it was quite complicated to get it working and was never able to record a personalized greeting. Later in the day, I got a call from a stranger in the adjacent state asking why I was calling his cell-- I hadn't, but my cell number had! No parental controls,  can't set up Google at all for a find account,  would not recognize what is a valid account.Junked the cards and added my child into our Verizon Family Plan for an additional $20/month, locked in,  not an introductory rate like Mint's $15/mo.

I tried the SIM (and Mint Mobile app) in three different unlocked Android phones: 1) an HTC One M8 that was formerly tied to the AT&T network but is now unlocked, 2) an LG V20 H910 that was formerly tied to the AT&T network but is now unlocked, and 3) an LG V20 H918 that was formerly tied to the T-Mobile network but is now unlocked.  All three phones have clean IMEI numbers and are unlocked for any GSM carrier.  All three phones work fine with a Cricket SIM (which uses the AT&T network); none work AT ALL with the Mint Mobile SIM (which uses the T-Mobile network).  Even the H918 variant of the LG V20 -- which was originally sold for use on the T-Mobile network -- refuses to work with the Mint Mobile SIM.  The HTC phone detects the Mint network but states that the SIM cannot be used on that network.  WTF?  A Mint SIM can't be used on the Mint network?  Maybe I got a bad SIM, but it's not worth potentially wasting a lot more time and another $5 to try again.  Three strikes and you're out, Mint Mobile."

So he contacted the company with me on (different) line to unlock the phone with Simple Mobile, who said it will take up to two days to unlock, and if that doesn't work, to contact them again after two days to attempt a new unlock.This means my phone is dead for a couple days without service and no backup phone service. He tells me there's nothing more he can do and hangs up. He should have known and informed me to first unlock the phone before he attempted any transfer, to avoid disruption of service, because this is what he does. It is his job.And this was the reason why I wanted a live person to assist, as oppose to using a website so as to avoid any potential problems.The government made laws to make number transfer very easy. it was done in a few minutes.

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2021",
      "body": "I thought this was a great idea to test to see if a carrier works in my extremely rural area.The big 3 typically only get one maybe 2 bars. CDMA usually a bit better deep in the woods. I wanted to test this around the 80 acres of property we have, but I couldn't even activate it!The app gave me an error. As did the PC website. 611 activation transferred me to a rep in India. Quick transfer with no hold time at 5PM on a Monday. That was impressive.The first thing the rep asked me was if I bought it off Amazon. He further went on the state he recvs several calls a day in regards to this. Specifically sales off Amazon. And this is supposedly a direct Mint Mobile store? I ordered 2 more because they're cheaper than porting my number over to a phone line that may not even work.  The rep advised me to buy a trial sim at Best Buy or Target. My local Target doesn't stock it, nor can get it online. Best Buy is 2 hours away.Kinda a joke and a bad way to convince customers to move to a different carrier if they can't even activate the darned SIM.  There is no point of saving money on cellular if you can't even use it.More than likely I'll get a sim from T-mobile and go directly through them.Bad, Ryan Reynolds. Bad! No pooping in the house. You poop outside!",
