In fact, after three days, almost 17 hours of talking on the phone with Assurance, they still could not fully unlock the phone.Also, I did not receive the pointer to take out the SIM tray.  Also, I did not receive a manual.  I understand it was rebuilt, but there had to be a way to provide something.The box did not tell me what the IMEI was.  I had to charge the phone to turn it on, to search for this information on the phone.  According to Assurance Wireless, this was not an Assurance phone, and it can not be unlocked.  Horrible, horrible, horribleexperience, and several lies were told in this ad.  Amazon should do more to protect it's customers when dealing with potential scams.  Your ad said the right thing to getme to buy it, but did not come through with the important details.  This whole ordeal made me real frustrated.",

The phone arrived on time, Unbroken, And with a power adapter & cable ♥️.While the phone is completely unlocked and works for my SIM card. My only gripe is that it is an unlocked A.T.T phone which includes all the AT&T bloatware you cannot uninstall🤔.This would have been a great buy of we could choose the Att pr Tmoble ver from checkout 🤷Total geek note, if you turn on developer mode and install an SD card this phone & software allows you to force app installs to SD😄 this can free up more space for more apps. Just remember they SD card apps run slower the internal memory. This phone handled a 64gb ONN brand card no problem😉Male sure to buy a good case & screen protector too. It's a very thin glass phone.",

But, as is always the case, you get what you pay for.  It runs insanely slow.  I added an SD card thinking I could take some of the heavy lifting off the processor by adding more storage space.  Nada.  I've had to restart it more times than I would like because apps just stop being recognized by the phone.  It drops calls like crazy.  These are all issues I never had with my previous phone and I've lived and worked from home in the same house for over a decade.  I am in no way hard on my phones.  They usually last me 4 or 5 years until the software becomes obsolete.  I play no games and have minimal apps. So its not like I'm pushing this thing overly hard. I probably spend less than an hour every day talking on it and only slightly longer running apps on it.  I have to admit I regret my purchase.  I certainly won't be buying one again and if I didn't desperately need the phone and was capable of dropping $1000 on a newer, better phone, I would get rid of it.  Don't waste your money, even if its not a lot.  It's not worth it."

In fact, after three days, almost 17 hours of talking on the phone with Assurance, they still could not fully unlock the phone.Also, I did not receive the pointer to take out the SIM tray.  Also, I did not receive a manual.  I understand it was rebuilt, but there had to be a way to provide something.The box did not tell me what the IMEI was.  I had to charge the phone to turn it on, to search for this information on the phone.  According to Assurance Wireless, this was not an Assurance phone, and it can not be unlocked.  Horrible, horrible, horribleexperience, and several lies were told in this ad.  Amazon should do more to protect it's customers when dealing with potential scams.  Your ad said the right thing to getme to buy it, but did not come through with the important details.  This whole ordeal made me real frustrated.",

But, as is always the case, you get what you pay for.  It runs insanely slow.  I added an SD card thinking I could take some of the heavy lifting off the processor by adding more storage space.  Nada.  I've had to restart it more times than I would like because apps just stop being recognized by the phone.  It drops calls like crazy.  These are all issues I never had with my previous phone and I've lived and worked from home in the same house for over a decade.  I am in no way hard on my phones.  They usually last me 4 or 5 years until the software becomes obsolete.  I play no games and have minimal apps. So its not like I'm pushing this thing overly hard. I probably spend less than an hour every day talking on it and only slightly longer running apps on it.  I have to admit I regret my purchase.  I certainly won't be buying one again and if I didn't desperately need the phone and was capable of dropping $1000 on a newer, better phone, I would get rid of it.  Don't waste your money, even if its not a lot.  It's not worth it."

When I first turned on the phone, I noticed something odd – the description mentioned AT&T Unlocked, but a Metro by T-Mobile logo appeared on startup. As I started setting it up, I was immediately asked for a phone password due to an FRP (Factory Reset Protection) lock. When I clicked “don’t remember password,” it asked for the previous user’s email address. After a few minutes, the phone went to a blue screen and now it won’t even turn on.
