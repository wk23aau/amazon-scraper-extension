      "body": "I was surprised to see there was no bubble wrap or shipping paper inside the box so my phone box wouldn't be bouncing around throughout shipping. But luckily the phone was unopened and undamaged.It's a bit smaller than I expected but the screen size doesn't affect my texting at all. Operating software is smooth, picture is crisp and clean; camera is incredible, it came unlocked and all I had to do was put my Boost Mobile sim card from my old phone into this one and download a boost configuration app, so it was really easy switching everything over. Just plugged one phone into another to transfer all my apps and data from my old phone..It fits nicely in my hand and my pockets.. it's not heavy so my pants aren't being weighed down by it.I must say I'm inpressed by this Pixel, I've used the 2xl and the 7 pro and always was impressed. The 8a is worth every penny.  Ppl were complaining about fongr print reader but there's an option in your settings to turn up sensitivity to your screen and specifically your fingerprint reader. But you have facial recognition so really you never will need that fingerprint reader ..But I guess to each their own.I'd suggest buying phone if you're looking to downsize.. but I can see that being a bigggggg turnoff for a lot of customers. The screen I basically 6 in.",

      "body": "I am a pixel 8 user and bought this pixel 8a for my mom. Side by side, the main differences between these phones come out to the pixel 8a's slightly smaller screen, the pixel 8a's slightly larger screen bezels, and the case (which are very negligible when using a protective case).While many reviews and comparisons on the specifics between the pixel 8a's and 8's screens have been done, I can tell you that to my eyes the screen quality looks virtually identical. Same goes for the camera and image quality. I think overall the pixel8's camera+images might look a little cleaner, there are some lighting's conditions where I have found that the pixel8 a's camera out performed my 8's.Ultimately, for me at-least, the biggest difference between the 8a and the 8 that I have noticed is charging speed. My pixel 8 feels like it charges almost ~1.5x-2x the speed of this 8a. Which is really nice when taking advantage of Google's 80% battery capacity limiter. Despite needing to charge my phone a little more often with 80% capacity enabled, I can routinely get ~25% if not more of my phone charged on my 20 min drive to work.Overall, this 8a and 8 have been my favorite phones I have ever purchased. The front facing and rear facing cameras are both incredible and very easy to use. Both were purchased for $400, they offer essentially the best features from flagship smartphones, and are guaranteed 7 years of feature and software updates. Samsung and other brands might offer Android phones with more powerful hardware, but as a former Galaxy user, the overall experience the pixel 8a and 8 offer feel much more premium to me.",

      "body": "So, I've been using the 8a for about 6 months. I upgraded from the Pixel 5a due to support for that supposedly ending soon. I saw the 8a on sale so pounced. I'm mostly going to compare the 8a to the 5a. Keep in mind I really liked the 5a.8a vs 5aBattery life : 5a wins (slightly). I'm not sure how they compare on mAh but the 5a kept a charge a little longer. That's not to say the 8a won't last long. It pretty much always gets me through the day and I don't really feel held back by the difference.Screen: 8a wins (slightly). 8a is a little crisper, overall both are very good. Downside to the 8a is the screen size was a hair smaller I believe.Camera: 8a wins solidly. 5a took good pictures. 8a is even better, especially in low light. I also found the 8a AI editing feature to be handy at times.Charging: Mixed bag. 5a had a faster charging speed (although no Turbo charge). But I like having the wireless charging in the 8a which the 5a didn't have. After about 2yrs of 5a use the port was kinda loose. Wireless charging should negate that later problem of the port wearing out.Functional speed: 8a wins. 5a wasn't slow, but 8a is a little snappier.Headphone jack: 5a wins only because the 5a had one, 8a does not have a headphone jack. Most of my headphones/ear buds I use are wireless, but I still use a few wired ones. But you can get an adapter which has worked fine for the 8a.**Fingerprint reader/sensor: 5a wins by a long shot. This is the reason I removed a star. The 5a fingerprint reader on the back of the phone worked right nearly every time (except with moist fingers). The 8a in screen finger reader works more than half the time, but was is far less accurate than the 5a method. To make matters worse, I think the Pixel engineers forgot most people like to put a screen protector on. With a screen protector on the 8a, the fingerprint reader is nearly useless. (I had tried resetting the fingerprint scans to no avail). Maybe this wasn't the engineers' fault. Maybe a sales exec thought a fingerprint sensor on the screen sounded cool so demanded it while the engineers said it needed more work. But I digress.Out of frustration, I had started using the less secure face unlock which does work reasonably well. But the face unlock doesn't work well if you're wearing sunglasses or in dimly lit rooms. So, I've had to type the numerical unlock a lot more with the 8a.Overall this is a good phone at this price point that does most of what the expensive phones can do. But they need to overhaul the fingerprint sensor. Either move it to the back again or improve it so that it a) works nearly every time and b) works with most screen protectors.",

      "body": "I bought this 5 days ago. The initial set up was quick. I am now on day 5 of finishing of the set upü•¥  I has leftout so many things. I am having to set tons of preferences. None of them were added. Nor was any of my software transfered. That will probably take me a week to get installed and setup. I have a Nokia. So I don't know which phone is not transferring completely. My old phone is a G4 and this is a G5 and that maybe pert of the issue also, but I was told it should not be ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I worked Tech Support 20 years at a college and helped students with software issues helping use their laptops, tablets. When I was in the computer lab I was uncharge of install and troubleshoot software on the colleges Macs and PC's over our Intranet. Mac's and computer graphics were my specialty. I understand and can support various devices such as laptops and tablets and normally phones and teach them the basics of how to use 95% of software programs we teach until they get to the advanced stages and while installing / transferring and setting up new phones was not list of things the college did. I was allowed sit with the students and staff and instructors and teach setup a few college related things like setting up their phones to access our network and  their emails on our servers. I wasn't supposed to spend more than 15 minutes with each student when we were busy when we were not I would teach them more. After 15 minutes I set them up with a one of our technicians assigned to help with more complicated problems as my  main job was answering the phones and helping staff with minor issues or writing them up a ticket and assigning them to technician to help with classroom issues.This install and transfer has been a royal pain and taking way long than it has with my other phones!!!Can't tell you eases of use except that it seems like everything I do needs permission to access or troubleshooting. Which is a pain especially since it is supposedly storing the passwords. Like I said I don't know which phone is responsible for all the problems, but I almost feel starting from scratch and not transferring data might have been quicker.1 month later...Took it to my brother who has programed main frame computers couldn't get it to work after several hours. He said to return it!!",

It doesn't have fancy features like wireless charging that are built into the non-\"a\" models, and the CPU is technically a little slower... but you'll never notice. In practice, this is a minimal-bloat-and-shovelware Android system, delivered as Google intended it without bizarre modifications \"just to make it our own\" from some third party vendor.You'll also get security updates faster and more frequently than from third-party vendor phones, which is nice. In short, like I said: this is the phone you want this year, if you want to really nail the bang-for-the-buck meter."

I purchased a second Pixel 8a from Google as part of their Pixel 4a battery replacement program and it also had poor sound from a wired headset. I was using a 3.5 mm to USB adaptor purchased from Amazon.I also found that my calls without using the wired headset were as expected. The headset had worked well on the 3.5 mm plug on the Pixel 4a. I did not make the connection that the 3.5 mm to C adaptor was the problem.In researching this I found that the 3.5 mm to USB adaptor needs to have a DAV chip to convert digital to analog. Appears from Internet research Samsung has the same problem and solution."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024",
      "body": "Hardware-wise. the phone is light, nicely sized, and performs well.  However, the software user experience is just terrible and filled with frequent hostility.  If you don't like exactly what is in example screenshots, do not buy this unless you want to spend hours un-Pixeling it.  If you use software from not Google, prepare to work around Google.Customization is just poor, like i-device minimal and then somehow worse.  Google claims half the home screen for their own widgets (search and the barely useful At a Glance) that can't be disabled.  The color choices are heavily restricted forcing Google's choice of bland aesthetic with little way to customize it.  For some reason, widgets are HUGE despite the screen resolution and you can't change that, a serious issue when you only have half the home screen just to start with.  There's unusable space all over the screen on every screen.  The second thing I installed after bungling through the incredibly long on-boarding was to replace the Pixel Launcher with Nova, something I haven't even considered needing to do in years on other brands.Many apps are annoying to get working because of heavy-handed Google \"security\" that mostly just gets in the way of non-Google software and nothing else.  I spent hours searching for \"how do you disable\" on function after function to get a usable device.  If Google doesn't like you doing a thing, they (mostly) give you a way to work around that, but it's in the most absurd and hostile ways.  Like having only a \"Cancel\" button with a poorly worded \"do it anyway\" in a font 10% of the size of anything else and somewhere random on the screen nowhere near the button.After 1 day, I'm to the point that I think I'm going to return it and replace it with a phone from anyone else.  I only got this to have a phone with long software support while getting my normal phone repaired, not to be frustrated every time I try to use it.But if you like the Pixel experience and don't want to do anything different without a lot of work, then it's probably just fine.",

The camera and photo editing are a big step up from my old phone, and I especially like the guaranteed 7 years of updates as this is more than double what I had before.  The cell and wireless connections are quite good across multiple countries.I'm not a power user, and really appreciate this quality phone at half the price of the premium models.",

      "body": "While slightly on the smaller side this phone is perfectly adequate for most users. The unfortunate part is the cameras. While this phone was touted as a great device of videography, the cameras are well... DUMPSTER FIRES! Reviews all over the internet say that the cameras are great for content creation, 4k60 resolution ect, ect. Well these cameras HATE movement, diagonal tearing, pixleating (I know, IRONIC!) and not even Resolve can fix it. The only thing that makes them work good is LOTS OF LIGHT and staying still. Then yeah the quality is great, but in low light or action just forget about. Since the rest of the device works great, I don't feel too bad, but one of the PRIMARY REASONS I choose it not being as advertised just reinforced my hatred of modern electronics. That why I only give it 3 stars."

The thumb and the index finger are the most used for gripping things and they get scratched. The best finger for finger print readers is your ring finger - large enough, least used for grabbing.  Furthermore, its cold and dry now in Chicago and you get constant cracking of the most used fingers and the thumb is the worst.  I liked the old 5a where the finger sensor was underneath.  They should at least allow you to move the finger target to different places on the screen to favor the ring or other fingers.  Otherwise the phone is reliable in the couple months I have owned it.",

On my wife's phone, double-tapping the power switch returned the phone to the lock screen. If selected from the Home screen, the camera worked fine.After searching in vain for a solution on the internet, I ended up calling the Google help desk. They walked me through the correct setting. To turn on double-tap:- Go to Settings > System > Gestures- Tap Quickly Open Camera. (If it is not activated, it will show Off)- On the next screen, slide the switch to the right to activate the feature.There are other gestures in this page you may also find helpful: Quick Tap, Power & hold power button, etc.",

      "body": "My family has had 5 pixel phones starting with a 5a, 6a, two 7a, and finally this 8a.  The low rating is probably more about prior phones than this 8a phone.  I like the camera quality and that is what drew me to the pixel phones.  It feels like Android is getting a bit more glitchy, but so are most things these days.The reason I bought the pixel 8a is that after a little more than 2 years my old 5a screen stopped working.  you could tell the phone still worked because it still vibrates, but I couldn't get the screen to work.  2 years seemed a bit short for the life of a phone but the cost to fix the screen was too much so I bought a new 8a.Now Nov 2024, my son's 6a which we bought Oct 2023 stopped working Nov 2024 with the exact same issue.  Basically 1 month out of warranty, I reached out to Google, spoke to a representative who wouldn't do anything other than send me directions to a local shop which will charge me about $200 for the screen repair.  I asked for a manager at google and they opened a case and said I would hear back within 24 hours, it has now been a week.The phone in general has been good, but with 2 out of 5 phones having the same issue, I‚Äôm wondering how long the others we still use will work.  I will be researching other phones prior to our next phone purchase.  If you plan to purchase a pixel I would recommend the extended warranty unless you trade in your phone yearly.",

Sometimes I'd just receive a missed call (phone never rang...) After weeks of surfing the internet looking for a Samsung S23/24 deal I started noticing the Pixel line (8 Pro/8/8a). Finally, I fell for the 8a $499 (+ $100 gift card)...Pros: Light weight. Easy to transfer files from previous phone. Android 14 (7 years of updates (+++)). Perfect hand-sized.Cons: Touch screen is randomly effective in various areas; when touching an app it'll appear to sense (color change), but no action occurs, so sometimes I have to \"angry\" press to get it to take action. Just now, I had the same Motorola latency issue happen (side-by-side w/ Samsung). Signal issue, 5G UC drops to 5G to LTE for no reason (just sitting there. The tower is roughly .5 miles away.In the end I'll keep since it was a $499 - $100 phone.",

Nice full sound from the speakers, even has some bass.

I know google has a spotted history when it comes to sale prices on their other models, so maybe the pricing will not be as strong a driver as the Pixel 7 pros and Pixel 8s go on sale, but I am very happy with this budget model.The battery life last multiple days between charges for me, or for the entire day with heavy youtube usage. It can get slightly warm at times, but no warmer than my S9+ under heavy usage, so I am not concerned. Charge times are reasonable, but I am coming from an older phone, so maybe I am just easily impressed.The finger print scanner works great for me, and when used in conjunction with the face recognition, is pretty seamless.Overall, I am very happy with this phone, and will consider the Pixel phone family moving forward.",

It's not a \"cheap\" phone but certainly not at the high end either - as a phone it's fine, as a camera I'm finding it superior!  I love the software that lets you do some major editing right there on your phone.

I'm coming from a TCL 20xl as my personal phone. The only thing I disliked about that phone was the curved glass. So let's compare. The camera quality on this seems on par with the TCL, a phone that was half the price and 3 years older. This phone also has 2 stupid widgets that can't be removed from the home screen. One being the search bar and the other the date in the upper left had corner. So if you want to add a clock widget, you now have the date displayed twice side by side. Let us remove these widgets Google! Next, do you want to add a picture you took (in portrait) as your home screen? Cool, pixel can do that, but it's going to zoom in, cropping out half the people in the photo and there isn't a thing you can do to adjust the photo. It's already in the right orientation and size. Quit auto cropping. Perhaps most severe is it doesn't seem to want to stay connected to my wifi. I had to give it priority on the network just to function.  I'm going to give this thing a try, hopefully I can get used to it. I'll update if I find any that makes this phone stand out above a $250 3 year old phone or if I find more issues.Update: Minus a star. The touch screen also decides it doesn't want to work for a few moments. This especially occurs if the phone hasn't been used for a few hours. I thought it could be a screen protector, but once it decided to unfreeze, the touch screen works fine.",

I understand and can support various devices such as laptops and tablets and normally phones and teach them the basics of how to use 95% of software programs we teach until they get to the advanced stages and while installing / transferring and setting up new phones was not list of things the college did. I was allowed sit with the students and staff and instructors and teach setup a few college related things like setting up their phones to access our network and  their emails on our servers. I wasn't supposed to spend more than 15 minutes with each student when we were busy when we were not I would teach them more. After 15 minutes I set them up with a one of our technicians assigned to help with more complicated problems as my  main job was answering the phones and helping staff with minor issues or writing them up a ticket and assigning them to technician to help with classroom issues.This install and transfer has been a royal pain and taking way long than it has with my other phones!!!Can't tell you eases of use except that it seems like everything I do needs permission to access or troubleshooting. Which is a pain especially since it is supposedly storing the passwords. Like I said I don't know which phone is responsible for all the problems, but I almost feel starting from scratch and not transferring data might have been quicker.1 month later...Took it to my brother who has programed main frame computers couldn't get it to work after several hours. He said to return it!!",

      "body": "Hardware-wise. the phone is light, nicely sized, and performs well.  However, the software user experience is just terrible and filled with frequent hostility.  If you don't like exactly what is in example screenshots, do not buy this unless you want to spend hours un-Pixeling it.  If you use software from not Google, prepare to work around Google.Customization is just poor, like i-device minimal and then somehow worse.  Google claims half the home screen for their own widgets (search and the barely useful At a Glance) that can't be disabled.  The color choices are heavily restricted forcing Google's choice of bland aesthetic with little way to customize it.  For some reason, widgets are HUGE despite the screen resolution and you can't change that, a serious issue when you only have half the home screen just to start with.  There's unusable space all over the screen on every screen.  The second thing I installed after bungling through the incredibly long on-boarding was to replace the Pixel Launcher with Nova, something I haven't even considered needing to do in years on other brands.Many apps are annoying to get working because of heavy-handed Google \"security\" that mostly just gets in the way of non-Google software and nothing else.  I spent hours searching for \"how do you disable\" on function after function to get a usable device.  If Google doesn't like you doing a thing, they (mostly) give you a way to work around that, but it's in the most absurd and hostile ways.  Like having only a \"Cancel\" button with a poorly worded \"do it anyway\" in a font 10% of the size of anything else and somewhere random on the screen nowhere near the button.After 1 day, I'm to the point that I think I'm going to return it and replace it with a phone from anyone else.  I only got this to have a phone with long software support while getting my normal phone repaired, not to be frustrated every time I try to use it.But if you like the Pixel experience and don't want to do anything different without a lot of work, then it's probably just fine.",

While this phone was touted as a great device of videography, the cameras are well... DUMPSTER FIRES! Reviews all over the internet say that the cameras are great for content creation, 4k60 resolution ect, ect. Well these cameras HATE movement, diagonal tearing, pixleating (I know, IRONIC!) and not even Resolve can fix it. The only thing that makes them work good is LOTS OF LIGHT and staying still. Then yeah the quality is great, but in low light or action just forget about. Since the rest of the device works great, I don't feel too bad, but one of the PRIMARY REASONS I choose it not being as advertised just reinforced my hatred of modern electronics. That why I only give it 3 stars."

I like the finger print reader but its location favors your thumb.  I sold tons of finger print readers for access control systems.  The thumb and the index finger are the most used for gripping things and they get scratched. The best finger for finger print readers is your ring finger - large enough, least used for grabbing.  Furthermore, its cold and dry now in Chicago and you get constant cracking of the most used fingers and the thumb is the worst.  I liked the old 5a where the finger sensor was underneath.  They should at least allow you to move the finger target to different places on the screen to favor the ring or other fingers.  Otherwise the phone is reliable in the couple months I have owned it.",

      "body": "My family has had 5 pixel phones starting with a 5a, 6a, two 7a, and finally this 8a.  The low rating is probably more about prior phones than this 8a phone.  I like the camera quality and that is what drew me to the pixel phones.  It feels like Android is getting a bit more glitchy, but so are most things these days.The reason I bought the pixel 8a is that after a little more than 2 years my old 5a screen stopped working.  you could tell the phone still worked because it still vibrates, but I couldn't get the screen to work.  2 years seemed a bit short for the life of a phone but the cost to fix the screen was too much so I bought a new 8a.Now Nov 2024, my son's 6a which we bought Oct 2023 stopped working Nov 2024 with the exact same issue.  Basically 1 month out of warranty, I reached out to Google, spoke to a representative who wouldn't do anything other than send me directions to a local shop which will charge me about $200 for the screen repair.  I asked for a manager at google and they opened a case and said I would hear back within 24 hours, it has now been a week.The phone in general has been good, but with 2 out of 5 phones having the same issue, I‚Äôm wondering how long the others we still use will work.  I will be researching other phones prior to our next phone purchase.  If you plan to purchase a pixel I would recommend the extended warranty unless you trade in your phone yearly.",

Sometimes I'd just receive a missed call (phone never rang...) After weeks of surfing the internet looking for a Samsung S23/24 deal I started noticing the Pixel line (8 Pro/8/8a). Finally, I fell for the 8a $499 (+ $100 gift card)...Pros: Light weight. Easy to transfer files from previous phone. Android 14 (7 years of updates (+++)). Perfect hand-sized.Cons: Touch screen is randomly effective in various areas; when touching an app it'll appear to sense (color change), but no action occurs, so sometimes I have to \"angry\" press to get it to take action. Just now, I had the same Motorola latency issue happen (side-by-side w/ Samsung). Signal issue, 5G UC drops to 5G to LTE for no reason (just sitting there. The tower is roughly .5 miles away.In the end I'll keep since it was a $499 - $100 phone.",

I'm coming from a TCL 20xl as my personal phone. The only thing I disliked about that phone was the curved glass. So let's compare. The camera quality on this seems on par with the TCL, a phone that was half the price and 3 years older. This phone also has 2 stupid widgets that can't be removed from the home screen. One being the search bar and the other the date in the upper left had corner. So if you want to add a clock widget, you now have the date displayed twice side by side. Let us remove these widgets Google! Next, do you want to add a picture you took (in portrait) as your home screen? Cool, pixel can do that, but it's going to zoom in, cropping out half the people in the photo and there isn't a thing you can do to adjust the photo. It's already in the right orientation and size. Quit auto cropping. Perhaps most severe is it doesn't seem to want to stay connected to my wifi. I had to give it priority on the network just to function.  I'm going to give this thing a try, hopefully I can get used to it. I'll update if I find any that makes this phone stand out above a $250 3 year old phone or if I find more issues.Update: Minus a star. The touch screen also decides it doesn't want to work for a few moments. This especially occurs if the phone hasn't been used for a few hours. I thought it could be a screen protector, but once it decided to unfreeze, the touch screen works fine.",

      "body": "Upgraded from a Pixel 3a because it was finally starting to fail and crash. It's new, it's fast, but in just about every other way it's worse than the 3a was, which is absurd for a phone released in 2024.A short quick hit list of big things that are worse than the 3a:-runs hot; anything that takes some processing power will make this phone almost uncomfortably warm.-fingerprint sensor. It's no longer on the back, making unlocks awkward, and it's much less responsive. The sensor on the front is unreasonably bright when it's active. I have to redo my print weekly. The PIN unlock is also poorly designed, with unnecessary key presses to get through. The old swipe was so much better. This is a big one, because it makes unlocking take more attention and any use of your phone more annoying. Maybe it'll get me to use it less at least.-charges EXTREMELY slowly, regardless of the charger. Like an hour to go 15%? Hilarious.-the touch screen has some randomly weird responsiveness and sensitivity? This could be a software thing I guess, but, for example, the X button to cancel directions in Maps just simply won't work for me.-the Bluetooth is slower to connect; to pair with my car it typically fails at least twice.The good? The camera is great, and it's minimal on bloatware. Overall I just can't believe it's worse than my phone from 2019. I chose it over some better deals on some older pixel models because of the long-term updates, but with how poorly the charging and heat are when it's brand new I'll be amazed if it lasts that long. This will be my last Pixel.",

      "body": "If you go from a crappy old free Android phone to a new Pixel, it'll feel like an upgrade.If you go from an older generation Pixel to a newer gen, you will see the Shrinkflation all over it. It's a serious downgrade from three generations ago. Yes, it has a faster processor and better camera, but the old ones were already fast and took great pictures so the \"upgrade\" feels minimal. Plus you've now got a smaller screen, no hardware fingerprint sensor, unresponsive on-screen fingerprint scanner, no 1/8\" headphone jack, smaller battery, slower charging, and a big brick of the camera sticking off the back of the phone (5a did not have this).Like most big companies now-a-days, they are coasting on previous good products and name-recognition and partial monopoly on the market while reducing the over-all features and quality of the product over time.",

      "body": "Purchased July 2024. The good news is that the tensor processor with 8MB RAM is plenty snappy to handle every workload I threw at it. Long lasting battery and the screen is crisp and clear. Would be a nice phone for the price, but...I have had nothing but problems with Bluetooth devices and the Pixel 8a. Constantly get device unexpectedly disconnected error, have to re-connect and re-pair devices all day. Phone freezes when transferring a BT call from the car to the phone. Took it to UbreakIfix per google support for warranty repair. Replaced the main board, and guess what - the new main board has the same defect. No real surprise I guess. So now I'm 20 hours into trying to get this junk fixed; it's really difficult now since the serial number and imei have changed.Now its an exercise in futility since I already bought a new phone, but I'm curious how bad the google support experience can be - pretty bad so far.I asked for a refund but no bueno.In case you wonder: The Motorola phone before 8a connects and remains connected to all the same BT devices. The Samsung phone after 8a connects and remains connected to all the same BT devices. The Pixel 8a main board, and replacement main board are defective.Before you buy search for network and Bluetooth problems with Pixel 8a.Alas, one star for a defective phone that could have been a great deal. At least I can narrow my phone choices by one manufacturer the next time I shop.",

      "body": "This Pixel 8a Phone quit working 3 days after the return window closed. I purchased it at full price and it was described as unlocked. My mobile phone provider tried to fix it and could not because it was actually locked and could not even be turned on or shut down. I contacted Amazon Customer service and they gave me a link to the Google Pixel customer service website. Amazon said that I needed to have an email or something from Google Pixel saying that it was an unresolved problem before they could even give me a return label or credit since it was three days after the return window closed. I contacted the Google pixel customer service link provided to me by Amazon customer service and there was not even a phone number so I had to send a message. It has been three days and they have not responded to my inquiry. I am very dissatisfied that Amazon did not actually solve this issue for me. I paid full price and I am getting the runaround. It needs to be said that this is the first time I have ever written a negative review. Who is responsible for this? Amazon or Google pixel? I bought it through Amazon at full price. Needless to say how disappointed I am with both Amazon and Google.",

I read reviews elswhere that stated that adaptive conductivity could be the issue so I turned that off, and it's still overheated. I hated having a hot hand, It reminded me of when I bought a refurbished phone and had that issue.On another note it was easy to transfer all my data to 8a phone, and it was easy enough to figure out how to use it right away. I didn't mind the fingerprint sensor being on the front of the phone either, which had concerned me before purchase. I hope the phone defect was just a fluke, and doesn't happen to other phones, but I was turned off enough to return it and not want to try another one. My search for my phone will continue.",

I have learned to click everything (like buttons and icons) in the bottom left corner or it will just miss it.I contacted Google Support.

Very annoying. Also, it was always interrupting for advise. If I want advise, I'll to to settings. The calendar was annoying. The time wasn't always showing, so I had to open what I had scheduled to see what time I had scheduled it. I returned this phone. I'm a senior, and I don't recommend this phone for seniors. I'm glad Amazon gives me the ability to return. Especially when spending $300 plus to purchase something that you find annoying. Ug!",
